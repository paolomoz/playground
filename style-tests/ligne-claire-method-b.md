# ligne-claire

Crisp uniform black outlines of identical weight tracing every form — foreground figures, distant buildings, clouds, furniture, wrinkles in a sleeve — all drawn with the same precise pen width, filled with flat bright color like a stained-glass window made from a comic page. Detailed European cityscapes and interiors rendered with obsessive clarity, every brick and cobblestone outlined, every background as lovingly drawn as every face. The visual language of Hergé's Tintin and the Franco-Belgian bande dessinée tradition: clean, democratic linework where nothing hides in shadow and nothing is left vague.

| Urban Europe | Warm cream + dusty rose + ocean teal + warm brown + muted purple — Brussels, Paris, Mediterranean stone buildings under overcast skies |
| Desert Expedition | Sunshine yellow + warm red + Tintin orange + warm brown + white — sun-baked landscapes, sandstone, terracotta |
| Night Scene | Deep navy (#1E3A5F) + muted purple + warm yellow (window glow) + black + cream — nocturnal cityscapes with every window and streetlamp still crisply outlined |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Adventure** | Travel, exploration, exotic locations | Detailed panoramic landscapes, vehicles (trains, ships, rockets), characters in motion against richly drawn environments, clear horizon lines |
| **Urban** | City life, architecture, interiors | European building facades with every window, shutter, and balcony outlined, cobblestone streets, detailed room interiors with furniture and objects all given equal line attention |
| **Scientific** | Technology, diagrams, mechanisms | Cutaway views of machines and buildings rendered in uniform outline, labeled components, technical clarity with the warmth of hand-drawn illustration |
| **Documentary** | Reporting, journalism, explanation | Panel-sequence storytelling, characters gesturing toward subjects of explanation, detailed real-world settings rendered with journalistic attention |

## Visual Elements

- **Uniform line weight everywhere** — the single most important rule. Every outline, whether tracing a character's jawline, a distant mountain ridge, a coffee cup handle, or a cloud edge, uses the exact same pen width (approximately 1-2pt black). No thick-thin variation. No tapering. No emphasis through line weight.
- **Flat color fills with zero shading** — solid blocks of bright color filling each outlined region. No gradients, no cel-shading, no cast shadows rendered as darker tones. A red jacket is one flat red. A blue sky is one flat blue. Period.
- **Backgrounds drawn with the same detail and line weight as foregrounds** — a street scene shows every cobblestone outlined, every window pane in every building, every leaf on every tree, all in the same uniform line as the characters standing in the foreground. Nothing is "suggested" or sketched loosely.
- **Clear spatial layering without atmospheric perspective** — foreground, midground, and background are separated by overlap and position, never by line weight change, color fading, or blur. A mountain five miles away gets the same crisp black outline as a hand in the foreground.
- **Simple expressive faces on realistic bodies** — round or oval heads, dot eyes or small oval eyes, simple curved-line mouths, minimal noses (often just an upturned line or small wedge). Bodies have realistic human proportions, not exaggerated or super-deformed.
- **European architectural detail** — Art Deco apartment blocks, mansard roofs, dormer windows, wrought-iron balconies, cobblestone plazas, harbor waterfronts, Mediterranean villas — all rendered brick by brick in uniform outline.
- **Vehicles and machines drawn with affectionate precision** — vintage cars, biplanes, ocean liners, steam locomotives, rockets — every rivet, every porthole, every wheel spoke outlined with the same line weight as everything else.
- **White speech bubbles with thin black outline** — rounded rectangle or oval shape, small triangular pointer tail, hand-lettered text inside. Clean and legible. No jagged explosion shapes, no thought clouds with multiple bubbles.
- **Panel borders as thin black lines** — same weight as all other lines in the drawing. No thick dramatic borders. No borderless bleeding.
- **No hatching, cross-hatching, stippling, or feathering** — surface texture is communicated purely through flat color choice, never through ink technique. A wooden surface is a flat brown, not a cross-hatched pattern.
- **Minimal speed lines or motion effects** — movement shown through character pose, trailing dust clouds (outlined in uniform line), or small motion arcs, never through dramatic manga-style speed lines or blur.
- **Every object in a scene drawn completely** — nothing is cut off arbitrarily or faded out. If a bookshelf appears, every book spine is outlined. If a dashboard appears, every gauge and dial is drawn.

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large establishing-shot panel at top showing the full environment, smaller panels below zooming into specific details — the "camera" moves from wide to close | Tintin album page: splash panel of Marlinspike Hall exterior, then interior rooms in smaller panels |
| Flow/process | Horizontal strip of sequential panels reading left to right, each panel a discrete step in the process, consistent eye-level camera angle throughout | Classic BD page: 3-4 panels across, each showing the next moment in time |
| Comparison | Split composition — two detailed scenes side by side, separated by a thin panel border, same level of detail in both halves, differences visible through careful observation | Two rooms, two cities, two approaches — the viewer compares every outlined detail |
| Categories | Grid of equal-sized panels, each containing one category rendered as a detailed vignette — a complete little scene with figures, objects, and setting | Album grid: each panel a self-contained illustrated scene, not an icon |
| Central message | Single large panel filling the composition, a richly detailed scene with the key subject centered, every surrounding element supporting the narrative | Full-page illustration: a detailed cityscape or landscape with the subject at the visual center |
| Journey/timeline | Panoramic horizontal strip showing a path or road winding through a detailed landscape, with key moments marked along the route | Map-like progression through a drawn landscape, the path connecting locations |
| Cause/effect | Two-panel sequence: the "before" scene on the left drawn in full detail, the "after" scene on the right with the same environment transformed | Same room or setting, every detail present in both, the changes visible by comparison |
| Network/system | Cutaway architectural drawing showing interconnected rooms or spaces, figures in each space performing different activities, all drawn in uniform line | Cross-section of a building or vehicle, every compartment detailed, connections visible |
| Scale/magnitude | Same object or scene drawn at progressively larger scales across a sequence of panels, each panel revealing more outlined detail as we zoom in | From city to street to building to room to desk to object — each scale equally detailed |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Ligne Claire Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Documents, newspapers, file folders, books on shelves — physical paper objects rendered with every page edge outlined |
| Processes | Characters walking through a sequence of connected rooms or locations, each environment fully drawn |
| Systems | Cutaway building cross-section showing interconnected departments, pipes, wires, corridors — every connection visible and outlined |
| Connections | Telephone wires, roads, railway tracks, shipping routes on maps — physical infrastructure linking locations, drawn in uniform line |
| Growth | A plant growing across panels, a building under construction with scaffolding, a city expanding — shown through progressive detail addition |
| Time | Clock faces, sundials, changing sky color (flat fills — dawn pink, noon blue, sunset orange, night navy), calendar pages |
| Hierarchy | A building's floors — penthouse at top, basement at bottom, each floor a cross-section showing who occupies it and what they do |
| Speed | Vehicle in motion with small trailing dust cloud (outlined), slightly tilted horizon line, characters leaning forward in their seats |
| Stability | Solid architectural foundation — thick stone walls, deep foundations, all rendered in uniform outline, the building standing firm |
| Users/people | Specific character types with distinctive costumes and hairstyles — reporter in trench coat, scientist in lab coat, captain in uniform — each identifiable by silhouette |
| Ideas | Light bulb overhead, speech bubble with exclamation mark, character pointing upward with index finger, blueprint or diagram pinned to wall |
| Danger | Skull and crossbones sign, storm clouds on horizon (flat dark fill, outlined edges), cracking ground, tilting structures |
| Discovery | Character peering through magnifying glass, pulling back a curtain to reveal a detailed scene behind, opening a door to a new environment |
| Communication | Speech bubbles connecting figures in conversation, letters being handed over, radio equipment with outlined dials and wires |
| Complexity | A densely detailed machine with hundreds of outlined components, gears, tubes, wires — complex but every part individually clear and traceable |

## Typography

- Clean sans-serif lettering — upright, even weight, slightly hand-drawn but precise, like careful architectural hand-lettering
- ALL CAPS in speech bubbles, sentence case for captions and labels
- Consistent modest sizing — never shouting, never decorative, never competing with the illustration
- Black text on white balloons with thin black outline matching the illustration line weight
- Caption boxes: white or cream with thin black border, placed at top or bottom of panels
- Labels and annotations in a slightly smaller size, positioned with care to not overlap drawn elements
- **NO** bold display fonts, NO decorative typefaces, NO variable-width artistic lettering
- **NO** sound effect explosions (WHAAM! POW!) — this is not American comics

## Anti-Patterns

**NOT American superhero comics**: No thick-thin dramatic inking, no heavy shadows, no muscular exaggeration, no dynamic action poses with foreshortening. Ligne claire is calm, measured, and democratic in its line weight. If any line is thicker or thinner than any other line, it is wrong.

**NOT manga/anime**: No big sparkly eyes, no speed lines filling the background, no screentone dot patterns, no exaggerated expressions (sweat drops, anger veins, chibi reactions). Expressions are subtle — a raised eyebrow, a furrowed brow, a slightly open mouth.

**NOT Lichtenstein/Pop Art**: No Ben-Day dots, no halftone patterns, no melodramatic close-up faces filling the frame. Ligne claire always shows the full environment around its characters. **NO dots of any kind for shading.**

**NOT Daniel Clowes**: Not muted, not depressing, not alienating. Ligne claire colors are bright and optimistic — clear blues, warm reds, vivid greens. The mood is adventurous and curious, not existential.

**NOT sketchy or expressive**: No loose brushwork, no gestural marks, no visible artistic "hand." The line is precise, controlled, and mechanically uniform. If it looks spontaneous or energetic, it has missed the point.

**NOT gradient or rendered**: Absolutely NO gradients, NO soft shading, NO airbrush effects, NO cel-shading, NO ambient occlusion. Colors are FLAT. A red jacket is ONE red. A face is ONE peach. Shadows do not exist as darker color variants.

**NOT minimal or empty**: Unlike Daniel Clowes's alienating emptiness, ligne claire fills every corner with lovingly outlined detail. Backgrounds are FULL — every brick, every window, every piece of furniture drawn with the same care as the main characters.

**NOT golden-age comics**: No dramatic shadows, no halftone printing effects, no POW/BAM sound effects, no exaggerated action. Ligne claire is the quiet, precise, European alternative to American comic bombast.

**This must look like a page from a Tintin album — every element outlined in the same precise black line, filled with flat bright color, set in a richly detailed European environment — not like a generic "cartoon" or "comic illustration."**

Note: Ligne claire as a style is best understood through Hergé's Tintin albums (The Blue Lotus, Destination Moon, The Calculus Affair), Joost Swarte's editorial illustrations, Yves Chaland's Freddy Lombard, Ted Benoît's Ray Banana, and Jason's minimalist graphic novels. The Unsplash reference images are photographs of Brussels comic murals that reflect the BD tradition but are not direct examples of the illustration style itself.
