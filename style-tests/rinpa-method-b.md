# rinpa

Gold leaf meets bold nature — the decorative brilliance of Japan's Rinpa school (17th-19th century). Irises bursting in flat electric ultramarine against hammered gold, stylized waves crashing in repeated decorative curves, cherry blossoms scattered like confetti across shimmering metallic grounds. Nature abstracted into pure decorative power, where bold flat color shapes float on luminous beaten gold leaf backgrounds with no shadow, no perspective, and no apology.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Gold | Ultramarine blue irises + vermillion red plum blossoms + hammered gold ground + ink black branch silhouettes — Korin at his most iconic |
| Silver Autumn | Malachite green grasses + plum purple chrysanthemums + silver leaf ground + saffron yellow highlights — melancholy autumn elegance |
| Red & Gold | Deep vermillion flowers + gold leaf ground + white gofun petals + black ink outlines — maximum decorative luxury, temple screen energy |
| Iris Garden | Electric ultramarine blue petals + malachite green sword-leaf foliage + gold ground + no other colors — Korin's Irises screen, the purest Rinpa composition |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Korin** | Bold flat shapes on gold, extreme simplification, maximum decorative impact | Irises as flat ultramarine silhouettes with green sword-leaves floating on hammered gold, plum branches as bold black ink silhouettes with white gofun blossoms, entire compositions reduced to shape and color on precious metal — every form simplified to its most graphic, most decorative essence |
| **Sotatsu** | Tarashikomi wet-into-wet ink pooling, controlled organic accidents | Ink dropped into still-wet ink creating bleeding pools with dark edges around lighter centers — deer rendered with pooled ink bellies, grasses with feathered wet edges, the beauty of controlled accidents on gold leaf. More atmospheric than Korin, more organic |
| **Hoitsu** | Refined seasonal elegance, delicate observation, poetic restraint | Cherry blossoms with individually observed pink petals falling against silver leaf, autumn grasses bending in wind against gold, more naturalistic rendering but still flat and decorative. The gentlest Rinpa — seasonal poetry rendered as visual art |
| **Kenzan** | Ceramic-inspired pattern integration, geometric meets organic | Geometric tile patterns mixed with bold nature motifs — circles containing chrysanthemum forms, checkerboard grounds behind iris silhouettes, the pottery decorator's sensibility applied to screen painting. More structured than other variants |

## Visual Elements

- **Hammered gold leaf backgrounds with visible beaten-metal texture** — not smooth gradient gold, but real metal leaf with subtle dimples, creases, visible sheet edges, and warm luminous variation across the surface. The gold ground is the foundation of everything
- **Bold flat color shapes with absolutely no internal shading** — an iris petal is ONE flat plane of ultramarine blue, a plum blossom is ONE flat white gofun circle. No gradients within shapes, no light-and-shadow modeling, pure flat decorative color
- **Dramatic asymmetrical compositions with subjects cut off at frame edges** — irises cropped at the bottom so only their upper blooms are visible, plum branches sliced by the frame edge, implying the subject continues endlessly beyond the painting
- **Stylized waves in repeating decorative curve patterns** — water rendered as rhythmic repeated curling lines stacked in rows, each wave crest identical, the ocean as wallpaper pattern rather than realistic seascape. White gofun foam tips on blue-green water
- **Tarashikomi pooling technique** — wet ink dropped into wet areas creating dark-rimmed pools where pigment has migrated to edges, leaving lighter centers. This wet-bleed effect appears on leaves, deer bodies, rock surfaces — organic and slightly unpredictable
- **Cherry blossom petals scattered across gold** — individual pink and white petals floating and tumbling across luminous gold ground, some clustered on branches, others drifting alone in mid-fall. Petals as confetti against precious metal
- **Irises as bold upright architectural forms** — tall straight green sword-leaves and fat blue blooms standing like soldiers in formation, the most iconic Rinpa subject. Leaves are flat green blades, flowers are flat blue masses
- **Plum branches as bold black ink silhouettes** — thick gnarled black trunks painted in confident ink strokes with small white gofun blossoms (five-petaled circles) dotting the branches against gold
- **Horizontal cloud bands as gold dividers** — amorphous gold shapes floating horizontally across the composition, separating scenes or creating depth layers. Clouds are gold on gold with slightly different texture
- **Red sun disc or full moon** placed asymmetrically against gold sky — a single bold vermillion circle or silver circle commanding attention
- **Silver leaf for water, moonlight, and winter elements** — silver used as a cooler metallic ground for night scenes, water surfaces, and snowy landscapes
- **Thick black sumi ink outlines** defining shapes against gold — confident single-stroke brush lines separating color areas
- **White gofun (crushed shell powder) highlights** used for cranes, snow, moon reflections, and flower petals — a bright opaque white that sits ON TOP of the gold leaf surface
- **Nature subjects grouped and repeated as rhythmic decorative patterns** — not one iris but twelve irises in rhythmic rows, not one wave but waves repeating across the entire composition. Repetition as decoration

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked horizontal cloud bands of gold separating content tiers, most important content in the largest clear band, lesser content in narrower bands | Korin's folding screens with gold cloud bands creating horizontal registers |
| Flow/process | Flowing water pattern of repeated decorative curves carrying elements from right to left (traditional Japanese reading direction), each bend in the stream touching a new content element | Waves rolling across gold ground, elements placed at each wave crest |
| Connections | Plum branches arching across gold ground linking separate subject groups — a single bold black branch reaching from one content area to touch another | Korin's Red and White Plum Blossoms — the S-curved stream connecting the two trees |
| Cycles | Seasonal subjects arranged on shared gold ground — cherry (spring) flowing to iris (summer) to chrysanthemum (autumn) to plum (winter), each in its signature color treatment | Seasonal folding screen progression across six or eight panels |
| Comparison | Paired subjects on left and right halves (byobu paired-screen format) — each side with its own dominant color and nature motif, gold ground unifying both | Sotatsu's Wind God and Thunder God — two forces balanced across a shared gold space |
| Categories | Distinct nature subjects repeated in rhythmic bands across gold — one band of iris forms, another of chrysanthemum forms, another of wave forms, each visually distinct | Irises repeated as decorative regiment across a six-panel screen |
| Growth | Vertical iris stems or bamboo shoots rising from water at bottom to full bloom at top — growth as upward movement from roots in earth/water to flowers in sky | Irises growing from gold-painted stream surface, bulb to full blue bloom |
| Networks | Intertwining plum branches with blossoms at each junction node — the branch structure itself IS the network diagram, blossoms marking connection points | Gnarled plum tree with branches reaching in all directions, white blossoms at each fork |
| Radial | Chrysanthemum as center with petals radiating outward in concentric rings — information arranged in concentric flower-petal patterns around a central core | Kenzan ceramic chrysanthemum pattern — radial symmetry as information architecture |
| Layered | Elements floating at different implied depths on flat gold — cranes flying at top, clouds in middle, waves at bottom, all on the same flat gold surface but layered by vertical position | Cranes flying over waves — depth without perspective, layering without 3D |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Rinpa Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------|
| Data/information | Scattered cherry blossom petals on gold — more petals clustered together = more data, sparse drifting petals = less data. Each petal a data point on precious ground |
| Processes | Flowing wave patterns carrying the eye along a curved repeated path — the rhythmic curling water lines as sequential flow indicator |
| Systems | A gold folding screen with multiple panels — each panel a component of the system, gold leaf as the unifying substrate connecting all panels |
| Connections | Plum branches reaching across gold space — bold black ink branches connecting blossom nodes, the organic network of a living tree |
| Growth | Iris stems shooting upward from water surface to full bloom — from green bulb at base through straight sword-leaves to fat ultramarine flower heads at top |
| Time | Seasons progressing across panels — plum blossoms (winter-spring) to cherry (spring) to iris (summer) to chrysanthemum (autumn), colors shifting with the cycle |
| Hierarchy | Horizontal gold cloud bands stacking — content in higher cloud bands is more important, the largest clear panel holds the dominant message |
| Protection | Gold ground itself — the precious metal surface ELEVATING and PROTECTING what floats upon it, precious materials conferring dignity |
| Speed | Wave crests breaking in rapid repeated patterns, birds in flight formation across gold sky — dynamic subjects against static precious ground |
| Stability | Mountain silhouettes on gold ground, ancient gnarled pine tree with thick trunk and flat canopy — permanence and endurance |
| Users/people | Stylized figures in Heian court dress (twelve-layered kimono, tall black caps) simplified to flat decorative shapes — humans as decorative forms, not portraits |
| Ideas | Red sun disc on gold sky — a single bold vermillion circle commanding attention against the gold, impossible to ignore |
| Energy | Crashing wave crests, wind-blown grasses at sharp angles, dynamic diagonal compositions breaking across gold — nature's force captured decoratively |
| Categories | Different flower species, each in their signature flat color treatment — irises in blue, chrysanthemums in yellow, plum in white, each species a distinct decorative unit |
| Transformation | Chrysalis to butterfly, bud to open bloom, season to season — metamorphosis shown through sequential nature subjects on shared gold ground |

## Typography

- Bold brush calligraphy integrated directly into gold ground — text treated as a decorative element equal in importance to the nature subjects
- Titles rendered in thick black sumi ink, written with a loaded brush, placed within or beside nature compositions as part of the visual rhythm
- Labels float on gold like scattered petals — elegant running-script brush calligraphy, not boxed or contained
- Vermillion red seal stamps (hanko) placed at inscription endings and in corners as compositional punctuation marks and signature elements
- Text placed in vertical cartouches of contrasting color for maximum readability — deep indigo text on gold strip, or gold text on indigo strip
- No modern digital fonts — all text appears hand-brushed in traditional Japanese calligraphic style
- White gofun text on dark color bands for high-contrast readability when needed
- If Latin alphabet required, use a brush-script typeface that echoes the ink quality and organic variation of Japanese calligraphy

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT ukiyo-e** — Rinpa is DECORATIVE FLAT shapes on GOLD LEAF, not narrative woodblock print scenes of the floating world. NO linear perspective, NO architectural street scenes, NO Edo pleasure quarter narratives, NO sequential storytelling panels. Rinpa decorates; ukiyo-e narrates.
- **NOT sumi-e** — Rinpa uses BOLD SATURATED FLAT COLORS on GOLD METALLIC GROUND, not monochrome ink washes on white paper. NO misty atmospheric dissolving, NO brush-texture virtuosity, NO zen emptiness. Rinpa is OPULENT and DECORATIVE, sumi-e is austere and minimal.
- **NOT shan-shui** — Shan-shui creates atmospheric depth with receding mountain layers. Rinpa is FLAT with no atmospheric perspective. Nature subjects FLOAT on gold, they don't RECEDE into mist. If there's depth layering, it's wrong.
- **NOT realistic botanical illustration** — nature subjects are STYLIZED and SIMPLIFIED into bold flat decorative shapes. An iris is a flat blue mass, not a scientifically accurate rendering with visible stamen and pistil. If you can count the flower's anatomical parts, it's too detailed.
- **NOT a smooth digital gold gradient** — the gold must read as METAL LEAF with hammered texture, visible sheet boundaries, and warm luminous variation. A smooth gold-colored fill is not Rinpa.
- **NOT sparse minimalist white space** — Rinpa is DECORATIVE and often DENSE with repeated nature patterns. Empty space in Rinpa is GOLD, not white paper. If the background is white, it's wrong (unless silver variant).
- **NOT Western illuminated manuscript** — despite the use of gold, this is Japanese decorative art, not medieval European. No gothic letter forms, no vine borders, no religious iconography.
- **NO 3D rendering, NO realistic lighting, NO cast shadows** — everything is flat decorative shapes on flat metallic ground. If anything looks three-dimensional, it's wrong.
