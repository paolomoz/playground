# craft-handmade

Torn paper edges, visible glue smears, stitched fabric borders, and washi tape strips holding everything together — the warm, tactile aesthetic of a lovingly assembled scrapbook, a kindergarten art wall, or an Etsy shop header. Real material textures dominate: corrugated cardboard, kraft paper, cotton fabric, burlap, twine, and felt. Every element looks like it was cut with scissors (slightly crooked), glued with a glue stick (slightly wrinkled), or stitched with embroidery thread (slightly uneven). This is the visual language of handmade zines, craft fairs, and Pinterest DIY boards — Eric Carle's tissue-paper collage, Sabuda's pop-up engineering, the analog warmth of making things with your hands.

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Scrapbook** | Layered photos, journaling, decorative papers | Multiple paper layers with torn and deckle edges, photo corners, journaling strips, sticker embellishments, washi tape tabs, visible adhesive texture under transparent tape |
| **Collage** | Eric Carle-style torn tissue paper, cut shapes | Hand-torn paper shapes with visible fiber edges, layered translucent tissue papers creating color mixing at overlaps, painted textures on paper before cutting |
| **Sewing/Textile** | Stitched borders, felt applique, fabric textures | Running stitch borders in embroidery thread, cross-stitch labels, felt shapes with blanket-stitch edges, burlap and canvas textures, buttons as bullet points |
| **Letterpress/Stamp** | Rubber stamps, ink pads, hand-printed type | Slightly uneven ink coverage from rubber stamps, the characteristic ring of ink at stamp edges, wood-type letterpress texture, ink smudges and ghost prints |

## Visual Elements

- **Torn paper edges** — irregular, fibrous edges where paper has been ripped by hand, showing the paper's internal texture and layers. This is the single most defining handmade visual trait
- **Visible glue and tape** — strips of washi tape, masking tape, or clear tape holding elements in place, with visible wrinkles and air bubbles underneath
- **Stitched borders** — running stitch, backstitch, or cross-stitch lines in embroidery thread defining borders and connecting elements, with slightly uneven spacing
- **Kraft paper texture** — the warm brown surface of unbleached paper with visible fiber, small imperfections, and natural color variation
- **Corrugated cardboard** — the distinctive ribbed cross-section and wavy fluting texture, used as backgrounds or structural elements
- **Scissor-cut shapes** — slightly wobbly edges revealing hand-cutting, not the perfect curves of a die-cut machine
- **Buttons, brads, and paper clips** — small fastening hardware used as decorative elements, bullet points, or connection nodes
- **Rubber stamp impressions** — text and images with the characteristic slightly uneven ink distribution, heavier at edges, lighter in centers
- **Twine and string** — baker's twine, jute cord, or yarn used as connectors, borders, and hanging elements
- **Layered paper depth** — multiple paper layers creating real shadow depth, the topmost layer casting a subtle shadow on layers beneath
- **Pencil and pen marks** — hand-drawn lines with visible pressure variation, pencil shading with graphite texture, ballpoint pen cross-hatching
- **Fabric textures** — burlap weave, canvas grain, felt fuzz, cotton thread visible in close-up
- **Photo corners** — triangular corner mounts holding elements to the background, as in a traditional photo album
- **Notebook and graph paper** — lined, grid, or dot-grid paper as background surfaces, with visible margin lines and hole punches
- **Ephemera** — ticket stubs, postage stamps, receipts, tags, labels — found paper objects integrated into the composition

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Layered paper stack with the most important content on the topmost, largest sheet, supporting details on smaller papers underneath | Scrapbook page with a hero photo and supporting journaling strips |
| Flow/process | Elements connected by a length of baker's twine or stitched thread, the path meandering across a cork board | String-and-pin investigation board connecting clues |
| Connections | Pieces of string or yarn connecting pinned elements on a cork board or fabric surface | Conspiracy board with red string |
| Cycles | Elements arranged in a circle on a round doily or on a paper plate, connected by a circular stitch line | Wreath-like arrangement of paper elements |
| Comparison | Two contrasting paper swatches side by side — different textures, colors, or patterns, separated by a strip of washi tape | Fabric swatch comparison in a material sample book |
| Categories | Grid of small paper tags or labels pinned to a cork board, each tag a different shape or color for its category | Craft supply organizer with labeled compartments |
| Growth | Ascending steps made from stacked cardboard pieces, each step taller, with paper elements growing like a pop-up book | Pop-up book page with progressive paper layers |
| Networks | Cork board with photos, notes, and clippings connected by pins and string in a web pattern | Detective's evidence board |
| Timeline | Horizontal strip of paper with elements attached at intervals using paper clips, brads, or tape tabs | Scrapbook timeline strip with dated photos |
| Assembly | Exploded view of a paper craft showing all cut pieces before assembly, arranged around the finished object | Paper model kit instruction sheet |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Craft/Handmade Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Data/information | Stacked paper notes, index cards, or sticky notes — more cards = more data, thicker stack = more volume |
| Processes | A sequence of craft steps — cut, fold, glue, stitch — each step shown with the relevant tool and material |
| Systems | A paper model or pop-up mechanism — interconnected folded paper parts that work together when assembled |
| Connections | String, twine, or yarn stretched between pinned elements — the physical act of tying things together |
| Growth | A paper seedling growing into a full paper flower — progressively more paper layers and complexity |
| Time | A calendar page, a dated journal entry, postmark stamps with different dates |
| Hierarchy | Layered papers stacked with the most important on top, casting shadow on subordinate layers beneath |
| Protection | An envelope enclosing content, a paper wrapper, a box lid covering something precious |
| Speed | Quick pencil sketch lines, dashed stitch marks, a paper airplane in flight |
| Stability | Heavy cardboard base, multiple layers of glued paper creating thickness, a stitched seam holding firmly |
| Users/people | Simple paper dolls or felt figures with button eyes and yarn hair — each one handmade and individual |
| Ideas | A hand-drawn lightbulb on a sticky note, or a crumpled paper ball being un-crumpled into a smooth sheet |
| Energy | Confetti, torn paper scraps flying, energetic scribble marks, exclamation-mark rubber stamps |
| Tension/conflict | A torn paper edge where something has been ripped apart, fraying thread, a broken stitch line |
| Authenticity | Visible materials and construction — nothing hidden, every seam and join and glue mark on display |

## Typography

- Hand-lettered or hand-drawn letterforms with visible pencil construction lines and slight wobble
- Rubber-stamped text with characteristic uneven ink distribution — heavier at the edges of each letter
- Typewriter text on notebook paper — monospaced, slightly misaligned, occasional heavy strikes
- Cut-out magazine letters for ransom-note style headlines — each letter a different font, size, and color from a different source
- Embroidered or cross-stitched letters on fabric backgrounds — each letter formed from tiny X marks
- Label-maker embossed tape (Dymo-style) — white raised letters on colored plastic strips
- Pencil or pen handwriting — natural, slightly messy, with character and personality
- NO perfect digital fonts used straight — if digital type is used, it should be printed, then photographed or scanned to re-introduce analog imperfection
- Washi tape labels — text written on strips of decorative tape

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT digital flat illustration** — craft-handmade must show REAL MATERIAL TEXTURES — paper fiber, fabric weave, glue residue, pencil graphite. Smooth vector fills are the opposite of this style.
- **NOT corporate Memphis** — corporate Memphis is slick, digital, and deliberately inhuman. Craft-handmade is rough, analog, and emphatically human. NO long-limbed blobby figures, NO smooth gradient backgrounds.
- **NOT skeuomorphic UI design** — while both reference physical materials, skeuomorphic design is about making digital interfaces look like physical objects (leather textures, chrome buttons). Craft-handmade is about actual handmade craft processes.
- **NOT art journal or mixed media fine art** — art journals are personal, expressive, and often abstract. Craft-handmade for infographics is organized, informational, and legible — it uses craft materials to present clear content, not for self-expression.
- **NOT vintage or retro** — despite using old-fashioned materials, the aesthetic is contemporary maker culture, not sepia-toned nostalgia. NO aged/yellowed effects, NO distressed vintage filters.
- **NOT watercolor illustration** — watercolor is a painting technique. Craft-handmade is about CONSTRUCTION — cutting, gluing, stitching, stamping. The assembly process should be visible.
- **NOT minimalist Scandinavian** — Scandi design is clean, precise, and restrained. Craft-handmade is layered, textured, and happily messy. If it looks like a Muji store, it is wrong.
- This must look like someone sat down at a table with scissors, paper, glue, tape, and thread and BUILT an infographic by hand — visible construction, real materials, analog warmth — not a digital illustration that references craft aesthetics.

## Best For

DIY tutorials, recipe cards, craft project guides, children's education, maker movement content, sustainability and eco topics, small business and Etsy-style brand identity, wedding and event planning, scrapbooking-adjacent content, community and grassroots organizations, analog vs. digital comparisons, anything that benefits from warmth, approachability, and the visible evidence of human handwork.
