# claymation

Chunky, tactile, deliberately imperfect stop-motion figures sculpted from colored modeling clay — fingerprint textures pressed into soft surfaces, tiny ball-and-socket joints visible at wrists and ankles, googly eyes that are slightly misaligned, everything sitting on a miniature tabletop set with visible seams and handmade props. This is Aardman's Wallace & Gromit, Laika's Coraline armatures, Art Clokey's Gumby stretched mid-stride — three-dimensional characters frozen in a single frame of painstaking hand-animated movement, lit by real miniature studio lights casting soft directional shadows across lumpy clay surfaces.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Wallace & Gromit | Sky blue + leaf green + sunshine yellow + tabletop tan — warm British kitchen energy, cheerful and inviting, clay-textured surfaces |
| Nightmare Before Christmas | Deep clay brown + charcoal gray + bubblegum pink + lavender — darker stop-motion moods, Tim Burton's color sensibility translated to clay |
| Gumby Classic | Leaf green + clay red + orange peel + craft paper beige — retro 1960s Clokey palette, primary colors against neutral sets |
| Coraline | Sky blue + lavender + deep brown + mint — Laika's sophisticated stop-motion palette, slightly eerie pastels against dark grounds |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Aardman** | Warm, comedic, rounded British charm | Wide grins showing teeth made from tiny clay sausages, oversized hands with visible finger sculpt marks, warm studio lighting, cozy domestic sets with miniature wallpaper and tiny props |
| **Laika** | Cinematic, detailed, slightly eerie | More refined sculpting with visible but controlled texture, dramatic lighting with strong shadows, intricate miniature environments, sophisticated color grading |
| **Retro Plasticine** | Bright, simple, nostalgic | Bold primary-colored clay on simple flat backgrounds, minimal detail, chunky proportions like Morph or Pingu, visible thumbprints everywhere, deliberately crude charm |
| **Mixed Media** | Clay figures on real-world backgrounds | Clay characters interact with photographed or painted backdrops, collage-like mix of handmade and found materials, cut-paper props alongside sculpted figures |

## Visual Elements

- **Visible fingerprint textures** pressed into every clay surface — thumbprints, palm lines, and tool marks that prove human hands shaped every piece. This is the single most important claymation visual trait
- **Soft rounded forms** with slightly lumpy, imperfect edges — no sharp geometric precision, everything has the organic wobble of hand-sculpted clay
- **Ball-and-socket joint marks** visible at character wrists, ankles, and necks — the mechanical armature peeking through the clay skin
- **Googly or bead eyes** slightly misaligned, giving characters a charming cross-eyed or wall-eyed look — never perfectly symmetrical
- **Miniature tabletop sets** with visible edges — you can almost see where the set ends, tiny furniture made from clay, wire, fabric scraps, and found objects
- **Warm directional studio lighting** casting soft but visible shadows — the look of real lights illuminating a physical miniature, not digital ambient light
- **Wire armature hints** — thin wire poking through at extremities, or the slight rigidity of a supported pose that reveals internal structure
- **Tiny handmade props** — miniature books, cups, tools, food items sculpted from clay with endearing crudeness, slightly oversized relative to figures
- **Surface irregularities** — small cracks, air bubbles, seam lines where two pieces of clay were pressed together, the occasional stray fiber or dust speck
- **Exaggerated proportions** — large heads on small bodies, enormous hands, tiny feet, wide mouths — the caricature logic of sculpted characters
- **Layered clay colors** — where one color meets another, you can see the thin seam of overlap, like real clay pieces pressed onto a body
- **Flat base plates** — characters standing on visible clay or wooden base plates that anchor them to the set
- **Toothy grins** — wide smiles made from individually sculpted tiny teeth, a signature Aardman visual
- **Subtle motion blur absence** — the crisp, slightly jerky quality of stop-motion, each frame a distinct frozen pose

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked shelves or platforms in a miniature set, each level holding different clay figures or objects, like a dollhouse cross-section | Wallace's basement workshop with gadgets on shelves |
| Flow/process | Clay figures arranged in a sequence of frozen poses, each figure slightly different, like keyframes in an animation | Stop-motion walk cycle displayed as sequential figures |
| Connections | Clay figures reaching toward each other with oversized hands, or connected by sculpted clay ropes, pipes, or wires | Characters passing objects across a miniature set |
| Cycles | Circular turntable arrangement with the same clay figure in different poses around the rotation, like a zoetrope | Animation turntable showing 360-degree character rotation |
| Comparison | Side-by-side miniature dioramas with different clay scenes, separated by a visible dividing wall | Two-room dollhouse with contrasting interiors |
| Categories | Grid of individual clay figures or objects on flat bases, each on its own small pedestal, museum display style | Character lineup on animation stage |
| Growth | Same clay figure shown at progressive stages of sculpting — from rough ball to refined character | Sculptor's progression from clay blob to finished model |
| Networks | Miniature city or village layout viewed from above, clay buildings connected by tiny roads, wires, or clay pipes | Model train layout populated with clay figures |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Claymation Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Stacked clay blocks or balls of proportional sizes — bigger clay lumps for bigger data, arranged on miniature shelves |
| Processes | Sequential frozen poses of a clay figure walking through stages, each pose a distinct keyframe |
| Systems | Miniature Rube Goldberg machine built from clay, wire, and found objects — interconnected mechanical parts |
| Connections | Clay figures holding hands or connected by sculpted clay tubes, wires visible underneath |
| Growth | A clay figure being progressively built up — first the wire armature, then basic shapes, then refined form |
| Time | A clay clock with moveable hands, or the same figure shown across a sequence of diorama boxes |
| Hierarchy | Clay figures of different sizes — the boss is literally a bigger clay figure standing on a taller platform |
| Protection | A clay shell, dome, or box enclosing smaller figures — the enclosure clearly hand-sculpted with visible fingerprints |
| Speed | Multiple ghosted clay positions suggesting movement, or a clay figure with tiny sculpted speed lines behind it |
| Stability | A heavy, solid clay block at the base, firmly pressed onto its base plate, everything anchored and grounded |
| Users/people | Expressive clay figures with distinct personality — each one unique, with individual quirks in their sculpted faces |
| Ideas | A clay lightbulb held overhead, or a sculpted thought bubble rising from a clay figure's head |
| Energy | A clay explosion or starburst — rays of clay radiating from a center point, each ray a different color |
| Tension/conflict | Two clay figures facing off with exaggerated scowls, or a clay object stretched between opposing forces |
| Craft/making | Visible tools — clay sculpting tools, wire cutters, the animator's hands entering frame |

## Typography

- Chunky, rounded sans-serif letterforms that look like they were pressed from clay — slightly uneven edges, soft corners
- Letters can appear as individual clay pieces pressed onto a flat background, each letter a slightly different thickness
- Embossed or impressed text — letters pushed INTO a clay surface leaving recessed impressions, or raised from the surface like bas-relief
- Handmade quality — no two letters perfectly identical, slight size and angle variation as if each was individually sculpted
- Clay tablet labels — text areas framed by a flat slab of clay with visible edges and fingerprint texture
- Color contrast: white or light clay letters on dark backgrounds, or dark impressed letters on light clay slabs
- NO digital-perfect fonts, NO thin elegant typefaces — everything must feel handmade, chunky, and tactile
- Titles can be formed from clay sausages bent into letter shapes, like a child's craft project

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT 3D CGI rendering** — Claymation must look HANDMADE with visible fingerprints, imperfections, and physical materiality. Smooth, perfect 3D renders with subsurface scattering and global illumination are NOT claymation. If it looks like Pixar, it is wrong.
- **NOT digital illustration with a "clay texture" filter** — the forms must feel genuinely sculpted, not flat art with a bumpy texture overlay. Real dimension, real shadows, real physical presence.
- **NOT cartoon or 2D animation** — claymation is inherently three-dimensional, photographed on physical sets with real lighting. Flat drawings with round shapes are NOT claymation.
- **NOT smooth polymer or vinyl toy aesthetic** — those are manufactured, perfect, and mass-produced. Claymation is hand-sculpted, imperfect, and one-of-a-kind. NO smooth matte finishes, NO factory precision.
- **NOT Memphis Design or pop art** — despite sharing bright colors, claymation is tactile and dimensional, not flat and graphic. NO thick black outlines, NO flat pattern fills.
- **NOT isometric or technical illustration** — claymation has organic, slightly wonky perspectives from being photographed on real sets, not precise geometric projection.
- **NOT realistic sculpture or figurative art** — claymation characters are caricatured, chunky, and deliberately non-realistic. If it looks like a museum bronze, it is wrong.
- This must look like a frame from a stop-motion animation — chunky clay figures with fingerprint textures, miniature handmade sets, warm studio lighting, charming imperfections — not a polished digital render or a flat illustration.
