# bold-graphic

Unapologetically loud, flat, high-contrast graphic design — the visual language of protest posters, album covers, Nike campaign billboards, and Aaron Draplin's thick-stroked identity work. Massive sans-serif type dominating the composition, shapes reduced to their boldest silhouettes, two or three colors maximum screaming at full saturation against stark backgrounds. Every element punches at billboard scale: thick strokes, hard edges, zero subtlety. This is Shepard Fairey's OBEY machine, Barbara Kruger's red-and-white confrontations, Paula Scher's typographic explosions, and Swiss punk posters stripped to their most aggressive essence — communication as visual impact, not decoration.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black (#000000), pure white (#FFFFFF), signal red (#E63946) — the power trio that anchors every bold-graphic composition
- Background: Stark white or solid black — never gray, never cream, never textured. The background is a weapon, not a surface
- Accent reds: Vermillion (#E74C3C), crimson (#C0392B), hot coral (#FF6B6B) — variations of red for when you need the one accent color
- Accent alternatives: Electric yellow (#FFD60A), traffic orange (#FF8C00), cobalt blue (#2962FF), acid green (#76FF03) — pick ONE per composition, never more
- No gradients, no shadows, no transparency — pure flat fills at 100% opacity
- Text: Black on white, white on black, white on red, or red on black — always maximum contrast, never subtle

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Kruger | Red + white + black — Barbara Kruger's signature. White text in red bars on black-and-white imagery. The most confrontational combination in graphic design |
| Monochrome Slam | Pure black + pure white only — maximum contrast, zero color. Silhouettes, reversed type, and hard edges. The Saul Bass end of bold-graphic |
| Warning | Black + electric yellow — caution tape energy, construction signage, hazard stripes. Impossible to ignore |
| Single Accent | Black + white + one saturated color (cobalt blue OR hot coral OR acid green) — 90% black and white, 10% color detonation |
| Inverted | White background + black dominant shapes + red accent — clean, poster-like, gallery-wall energy |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Poster** | Massive typography dominating the composition | Type IS the illustration. Enormous sans-serif words filling 70%+ of the frame, overlapping, cropped at edges, scaled to absurd size. Image elements secondary, squeezed into the gaps between letters. Paula Scher at maximum volume |
| **Stencil** | Cut-out silhouette aesthetic, spray-paint energy | Shapes reduced to high-contrast stencil silhouettes — no interior detail, just hard-edged black or red cutouts against white. Edges slightly rough like a physical stencil. Shepard Fairey, Banksy, protest poster urgency |
| **Stripe** | Bold horizontal or diagonal stripe bands carrying content | Thick horizontal stripes alternating black/white or black/red, with type and icons locked into the stripe rhythm. Information organized by stripe. Barbara Kruger's bar layout as a full system |
| **Icon** | Subjects reduced to their simplest possible silhouette | Every element reduced to a flat black or colored silhouette — no line, no detail, just shape. The pictogram aesthetic of AIGA signage or Otl Aicher's Munich Olympics icons, but scaled to poster size |
| **Collision** | Overlapping oversized elements competing for space | Multiple large-scale elements layered on top of each other — giant type over giant shape over giant type, all fighting for the viewer's eye. Controlled chaos, punk poster energy |

## Visual Elements

- **Massive sans-serif typography at billboard scale** — words so large they crop at the frame edges, filling 50-80% of the composition. The type IS the visual. Helvetica Black, Impact, Futura Extra Bold, Anton — weight over everything
- **Hard-edged flat silhouettes with zero interior detail** — objects reduced to their most recognizable outline, filled with solid black or one accent color. No shading, no line detail, no texture. The shadow on a wall at noon
- **Thick bold strokes on everything** — if there is a line, it is 6px minimum. Thin lines do not exist in this style. Every stroke has the confidence of a fat Sharpie marker
- **Maximum contrast at every junction** — black against white, red against black, white against red. No mid-tones, no near-values, no subtle color differences. Every edge is a visual cliff
- **Solid color bars and bands** — thick horizontal or diagonal stripes functioning as layout structure, not decoration. Type sits inside bars. Information organizes along bar rhythm
- **Cropped and bleeding elements** — shapes and type running off all four edges of the composition. Nothing is contained; everything pushes past the frame. The composition is a fragment of something larger
- **Reversed type (white on black or white on red)** — knockout text is the default, not an accent. White letters punched out of solid color blocks
- **Geometric shapes as pure signals** — circles, triangles, arrows used as attention-directing devices, not as illustrations. A red circle does not represent anything; it demands you look here
- **Diagonal cuts and angular crops** — compositions sliced at aggressive angles, dividing the frame into dynamic non-rectangular zones. Nothing is polite or centered
- **Extreme scale contrast** — a tiny word next to an enormous word. A small icon next to a massive shape. Scale difference creates hierarchy through visual force, not position
- **NO gradients, NO shadows, NO textures, NO rounded corners** — flatness is the religion. If you can see a drop shadow, a gradient, or a soft edge, strip it out
- **NO illustration detail, NO hatching, NO nuance** — this style communicates through blunt force. If it requires close reading to appreciate, it is too subtle
- **NO more than 3 colors in any composition** — the power comes from restriction. Black + white + one color. Period

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Massive word at top, medium word in middle, small word at bottom — size IS hierarchy, no other device needed | Paula Scher poster — one word screams, the rest whispers |
| Flow/process | Thick horizontal stripe bands stacked top-to-bottom, each stripe containing one step as reversed white type on alternating black/red bars | Kruger bar layout — each band a statement, sequence reads downward |
| Connections | Bold arrows or thick lines connecting silhouette icons — the connection is a thick black stroke, not a subtle dotted line | Wayfinding signage — bold arrows, simple icons, zero ambiguity |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of bold arrows chasing each other around a central icon, all in heavy stroke weight | Recycling symbol scaled to poster size — thick, bold, unmistakable |
| Comparison | Frame split diagonally — left half black background/white content, right half white background/black content. Mirror layout, inverted palette | Movie poster dual identity — hero/villain split composition |
| Categories | Each category gets a full horizontal stripe band in its own color (from the restricted palette), with white reversed type labeling it | Filing system — each drawer a different bold color, each label punched out in white |
| Growth | Progressively larger type reading left-to-right — same word repeated at increasing scale, the rightmost version bleeding off the edge | "GROW GROW GROW" at 24pt, 72pt, 200pt — scale IS the message |
| Impact | Single centered silhouette icon at maximum scale against contrasting background, single word label beneath | OBEY poster — one image, one word, total visual authority |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Bold-Graphic Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Proportionally scaled silhouette icons — bigger icon = more data. No charts; just size comparison of identical shapes |
| Processes | Thick arrow pointing right through a sequence of stripe bands, each band a stage |
| Systems | Interlocking black and white silhouette shapes fitting together like a jigsaw — negative and positive space as system components |
| Connections | Heavy black lines or arrows physically linking silhouette nodes — visible, thick, undeniable |
| Growth | Type or shapes scaling up dramatically from left to right — SMALL to ENORMOUS |
| Time | Left-to-right horizontal stripe sequence, each band a time period labeled in bold reversed type |
| Hierarchy | Size. The most important thing is biggest. Nothing else matters for expressing rank |
| Protection | Black circle or shield silhouette enclosing content in white reversed type |
| Speed | Diagonal slashes, angled crops, italic bold type — everything tilted forward at velocity |
| Stability | Centered, horizontal, heavy black shape anchoring the bottom of the composition — a visual foundation |
| Users/people | Simplified human silhouettes in solid black — no faces, no detail, the universal bathroom-sign figure scaled to poster size |
| Ideas | Starburst or explosion silhouette in accent color — a visual shout radiating outward |
| Energy | Diagonal stripe bands, collision of oversized elements, red accent at maximum saturation |
| Tension/conflict | Split frame — black on one side, white on the other, content mirrored and inverted across the divide |

## Typography

- Ultra-bold condensed sans-serif ONLY — Helvetica Black, Impact, Futura Extra Bold, Anton, Oswald Bold. Weight is non-negotiable. If the font has a "Thin" variant, this style uses the opposite end of the family
- Type fills the frame — headlines at 150pt+, cropped at edges, bleeding off the composition. The type is not IN the composition; it IS the composition
- All caps for headlines and labels — lowercase is too quiet for this style
- White reversed out of black or red bars is the default text treatment. Black text on white is the secondary option. Never colored text on colored background
- Maximum two type sizes per composition: enormous (headlines) and small (supporting text). No medium. Scale contrast creates hierarchy
- Letter-spacing: tight for headlines (letters nearly touching or overlapping), wide for small labels
- Text can overlap images, shapes, and other text — layering creates energy
- NO serif fonts, NO script fonts, NO handwritten fonts, NO decorative fonts — geometric sans-serif at maximum weight is the only voice
- NO centered, polite, balanced type layouts — push text to edges, crop it, scale it beyond comfort

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT pop art / Lichtenstein** — pop art uses halftone dots, comic-book line art, speech bubbles, and ironic commercial imagery. Bold-graphic is pure shape and type, no illustration vocabulary, no dots, no comics. If there are Ben-Day dots, it is pop art.
- **NOT Memphis Design** — Memphis uses clashing patterns (zigzags, terrazzo, squiggles), bright multi-color palettes, and playful irreverence. Bold-graphic uses 2-3 colors maximum, zero patterns, and confrontational directness. Memphis is a party; bold-graphic is a demand.
- **NOT Saul Bass movie posters** — Saul Bass uses narrative symbolism, mid-century color palettes (orange, olive, teal), and conceptual visual metaphors. Bold-graphic is more reductive and aggressive: pure shape, pure type, pure impact. If there is a clever visual metaphor, it may be Saul Bass.
- **NOT Swiss/International Style** — Swiss design is systematic, gridded, orderly, balanced, and uses generous white space with mathematical precision. Bold-graphic breaks the grid, fills the frame, and screams. If it looks harmonious and calm, it is Swiss, not bold-graphic.
- **NOT constructivism** — constructivism uses diagonal dynamic compositions but adds photomontage, layered textures, and political propaganda imagery. Bold-graphic is cleaner and flatter: no photomontage, no texture, no collage.
- **NOT minimalist** — minimalism values empty space, subtle relationships, and quiet impact. Bold-graphic fills space aggressively. There is no breathing room. Every square inch is claimed.
- **NOT gradient-heavy modern design** — no glassmorphism, no soft gradients, no neumorphism, no frosted glass. Pure flat fills at 100% opacity. If you can see through it or see a gradient, strip it.
- This must look like a Shepard Fairey wheat-paste poster on a construction wall or a Barbara Kruger gallery installation — aggressive, flat, high-contrast, typographically dominant — not a polished tech-company landing page that happens to use bold colors.

## Best For

Campaign messaging, brand identity, protest and advocacy, manifesto and mission statements, bold announcements, album covers, event posters, headline-driven content, anything that needs to hit the viewer like a billboard at 60mph — maximum visual impact with minimum visual complexity.
