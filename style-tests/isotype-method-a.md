# isotype

Rows of identical simplified pictograms arranged in strict horizontal lines on a clean grid — each symbol represents a counted unit, and meaning emerges purely from repetition, color-coding, and spatial grouping, never from perspective, shading, or decoration. This is the International System of Typographic Picture Education developed by Otto Neurath and designed by Gerd Arntz in 1920s-30s Vienna: statistical data made immediately legible through disciplined visual grammar where one icon equals one unit, color distinguishes category, and the viewer counts to comprehend. Every figure is a flat silhouette cut from a single color, every composition is a bar chart made of people and objects instead of rectangles.

## Color Palette
- Primary: Neurath red `#C23B22`, Isotype blue `#2B5C8A`, Isotype black `#1A1A1A`, Isotype green `#3A7D44`
- Background: Clean white `#FFFFFF`, warm off-white `#F5F0E6`, or pale cream `#FAF6ED` — always neutral and recessive
- Accents: Amber yellow `#D4A017`, warm brown `#8B5E3C`, dark gray `#4A4A4A`, muted orange `#CC6633`
- Text: Pure black `#1A1A1A` on white; dark gray `#3A3A3A` for secondary labels; NEVER colored text, NEVER decorative text
- Category coding: Each data category gets ONE solid color — red for one group, blue for another, black for a third — NEVER two colors in one icon

|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Pictorial Statistics | Rows of counted icons showing quantities, classic Isotype format | Horizontal rows of identical pictograms, each row a category, counts readable by row length |
| Comparative Chart | Side-by-side pictogram rows for direct comparison between groups | Aligned rows with clear category labels on left, color-coded groups, shared grid baseline |
| Process Diagram | Sequential steps shown as distinct pictogram scenes left to right | Numbered stages with arrow connectors, each stage a minimal pictogram scene on the shared baseline |
| Map with Symbols | Geographic context with Isotype pictograms placed at locations | Simplified flat map outline with pictogram clusters at relevant positions, legend in corner |

## Visual Elements
- **Identical repeated pictograms in counted rows**: The core Isotype principle — every icon in a row is EXACTLY identical in shape, size, and color; meaning comes from HOW MANY there are, not from individual variation; each icon represents a fixed unit (e.g., one figure = 1,000 people)
- **Flat solid-color silhouettes**: Every pictogram is a single flat color shape — pure silhouette with NO interior detail, NO outline stroke, NO facial features, NO gradients, NO shading. A human figure is a solid red shape. A factory is a solid black shape. Period
- **Strict horizontal row alignment**: Pictograms sit on invisible horizontal baselines in neat rows, aligned left, like lines of text. Rows are evenly spaced. The composition reads top to bottom, left to right, like a page of data
- **Category labels on the left margin**: Plain text labels aligned to the left of each pictogram row, identifying what that row represents — "Coal," "Steel," "Wheat" — in clean sans-serif type, no decoration
- **Unit key/legend**: A small boxed area (usually top-right or bottom-left) showing one example pictogram with "= 1,000 tons" or similar unit declaration, so the viewer understands the counting system
- **No perspective whatsoever**: Everything is flat, frontal, or in pure profile. There is NO vanishing point, NO depth, NO foreshortening, NO overlapping to suggest depth. The picture plane is absolutely flat
- **Geometric simplification to maximum**: Human figures are reduced to a circle (head) atop a simple body shape — no hands with individual fingers, no facial features, no clothing wrinkles. A car is four shapes: body, two wheels, window. Reduce everything to the MINIMUM recognizable form
- **Color as pure category marker**: Color does NOT represent realism (skin tone, material). Color ONLY marks which category/group the icon belongs to. Red figures = Group A. Blue figures = Group B. That is the ONLY function of color
- **Bold simple arrows or connectors**: When showing flow or sequence, use thick solid-color arrows — straight or right-angled, never curved, never decorative. Arrows are functional pointers, not design elements
- **Quantitative partial icons**: When a value requires a fraction (e.g., 2.5 units), the last icon in a row is shown as a vertically cropped half or quarter pictogram — cut cleanly, not scaled down
- **White space as active grid structure**: Generous consistent spacing between rows, between icon groups, and between label and pictogram areas. The white space IS the grid. It communicates organization
- **Pictogram families with consistent style**: All icons across the entire infographic share the same geometric simplification level — if people are shown as 7-shape silhouettes, vehicles must be equally simplified; never mix detailed icons with abstract ones
- **Horizontal axis = quantity, vertical axis = category**: The fundamental Isotype layout — categories stack vertically on the left, and pictogram rows extend horizontally to the right proportional to value

## Visual Metaphor Mappings
| Abstract Concept | Isotype Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------|
| Growth | A series of 3 pictogram rows for successive years, each row longer than the previous — 3 icons, then 5, then 8 — same icon, growing row length tells the story |
| Speed / Velocity | Two rows of vehicle pictograms — a short row of old vehicles (3 icons) above a long row of modern vehicles (8 icons) — speed implied by comparative quantity |
| Connection | Two groups of people pictograms on left and right with a bold horizontal arrow bridging them, the arrow in a distinct accent color |
| Danger / Risk | A row of standing person pictograms with the last 2-3 icons in red (danger color) while the others remain black — proportion communicates risk rate |
| Discovery | A magnifying glass pictogram positioned over a row of icons, the icons beneath it in a highlight color while others remain gray |
| Money / Cost | Rows of coin pictograms — each coin = $1,000 — stacked in counted rows with category labels; longer rows = higher cost |
| Time | A horizontal timeline with year labels evenly spaced, pictogram clusters above each year mark showing quantities at that point in time |
| Security / Protection | A shield pictogram at the left of a row of person icons, communicating coverage; the number of shields proportional to protection level |
| Communication | Two person pictograms facing each other with a speech-line (simple bold line) connecting them, replicated in rows to show scale |
| Global / International | A simple flat map outline with colored pictogram clusters at country positions — each cluster's count representing that nation's value |
| Complexity | A single pictogram row where each icon is a different type (person, factory, truck, building) — diversity of icon types within one row communicates complexity |
| Failure / Error | A row of pictograms where the final icons are shown in lighter gray or with an X mark — subtracted/missing units communicating loss |
| Innovation | A pictogram row showing a new icon type (lightbulb or gear) appearing at the right end of a row of older conventional icons — emergence of the new |
| Balance | Two pictogram rows of exactly equal length, one above the other, in contrasting colors — visual equality communicating equilibrium |
| Collaboration | Two differently-colored groups of person pictograms merging into a single mixed-color row — distinct groups combining into unified output |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Geometric sans-serif with clean circular forms — Futura, Neuzeit, or DIN; the letterforms must share the geometric purity of the pictograms themselves
- **Title Treatment**: Sentence case or ALL CAPS in medium weight Futura, generously tracked, left-aligned, 24-32pt equivalent; NO bold weight for titles — the title should not overpower the pictograms
- **Category Labels**: Left-aligned, regular weight, 11-14pt, in black or dark gray, positioned to the left of their corresponding pictogram row with consistent horizontal alignment
- **Unit Legend Text**: Small (9-11pt), regular weight, inside a thin-bordered rectangular box, reading "pictogram icon = X units" with the actual icon reproduced at label size
- **Axis Labels / Year Markers**: Regular weight, 10-12pt, evenly spaced along the bottom or left edge, acting as scale reference points
- **NO decorative, script, display, or serif typefaces**: Typography is purely functional — it labels and explains. It does NOT decorate. Futura is the canonical choice. Only geometric sans-serif faces are acceptable
- **NO large display type, NO expressive headlines**: The PICTOGRAMS are the visual content. Text is subordinate. Headlines should never compete with the icon rows for visual dominance

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO perspective, depth, or three-dimensionality**: The picture plane is ABSOLUTELY FLAT. There is NO vanishing point, NO shadows, NO foreshortening, NO overlapping layers suggesting depth. **Repeat: ZERO perspective. Everything is flat frontal or flat profile**
- **NO individual variation between repeated icons**: Every icon in a counted row must be PIXEL-IDENTICAL. Do NOT vary size, angle, position, color, or detail between instances. If one person icon faces left, ALL person icons face left. **IDENTICAL means IDENTICAL**
- **NO facial features, interior detail, or decorative elements on pictograms**: Icons are SOLID FLAT SILHOUETTES. No eyes, no mouths, no buttons, no wrinkles, no interior lines. A person is a solid color shape. **NO detail inside icons. NONE**
- **NO gradients, shading, highlights, or color transitions**: Every colored area is a SINGLE FLAT VALUE with hard edges. There are no gradients anywhere — not in backgrounds, not in icons, not in containers. **ZERO gradients**
- **NO outlines or strokes around pictograms**: Isotype icons are FILLED SILHOUETTES, not outlined shapes. There is no black border around them. The icon IS the color fill. **NO outlines on icons**
- **NO scattered, diagonal, or randomly placed icons**: Pictograms are placed on STRICT HORIZONTAL ROWS aligned to a grid. They do NOT scatter, float, spiral, radiate, or arrange in organic patterns. **GRID ONLY. ROWS ONLY**
- **NO illustrative scene-setting, backgrounds, or environmental detail**: The background is BLANK (white or off-white). There are NO landscapes, NO buildings in the background, NO contextual scenery. Only pictograms, labels, and white space. **BLANK backgrounds**
- **NO artistic expression, stylization, or embellishment**: This is a STATISTICAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, not art. Do NOT add decorative borders, ornamental corners, playful layouts, hand-drawn textures, or creative flourishes. **Function over decoration, ALWAYS**
- **NO realistic proportions or anatomical detail in figures**: Human figures are GEOMETRIC SYMBOLS — circle head, rectangular body, stick or block limbs. They are NOT realistic humans, NOT cartoon characters, NOT expressive figures. **Symbols, not characters**
- **NO curved arrows, wavy lines, or organic connectors**: All connecting elements are STRAIGHT or RIGHT-ANGLED. Arrows are bold, simple, and geometric. **NO curves, NO swoops, NO flowing lines**
- **NO photographic textures, paper textures, or material simulation**: The rendering is CLEAN FLAT DIGITAL. There is no paper grain, no ink bleeding, no print texture, no vintage aging effects. **Clean and flat**
- **NO mixing of detailed and abstract icons**: All pictograms across the entire infographic must share the SAME level of geometric simplification. If people are 5-shape silhouettes, vehicles must be equally abstracted. **Consistent abstraction level throughout**
- **NO large ornamental pictograms used as illustrations**: Icons are SMALL, COUNTED, REPEATED units. A single large decorative icon used as a hero illustration violates the entire Isotype principle. **Icons are DATA UNITS, not illustrations**
