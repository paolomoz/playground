# corporate-memphis

Flat, friendly, blobby human figures with disproportionately long limbs and tiny heads, rendered in muted pastel palettes of dusty purple, salmon pink, and teal — the ubiquitous illustration style of Silicon Valley tech companies from 2017-2022. Characters perform vaguely aspirational activities (high-fiving, planting trees, riding rockets) in a featureless void or atop gentle gradient backgrounds. This is the visual language of Slack onboarding screens, Notion landing pages, and every fintech app that wants to feel "human" — Alice Lee's original Slack illustrations industrialized into a global template of approachable corporate blandness.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Slack Classic | Dusty purple + salmon pink + soft teal + off-white — the canonical tech-company palette, friendly and non-threatening |
| Fintech Trust | Deep indigo + soft blue + muted yellow + pale mint — slightly more serious, financial credibility with a human touch |
| Wellness App | Warm coral + sage green + blush + very light lavender — soft, nurturing, self-care energy |
| SaaS Dashboard | Dusty purple + soft teal + charcoal blue + off-white — professional but approachable, the B2B sweet spot |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Slack/Alice Lee** | The original — warm, detailed, character-driven | More thoughtful compositions, slightly more artistic, visible personality in character design, natural poses, the pre-industrial version |
| **Humaaans** | Modular mix-and-match figure system | Pablo Stanley's interchangeable body parts — swap hairstyles, outfits, skin tones, poses. Maximum diversity signaling, minimum artistic individuality |
| **Big Tech Landing** | Hero illustration for homepage above-the-fold | Single large scene with 3-5 figures performing a collaborative activity — high-fiving, building something, launching a rocket — abstract geometric shapes floating nearby |
| **Empty State** | Small spot illustration for UI empty states | Single figure in a simple pose — sitting on a cloud, watering a plant, looking through binoculars — accompanied by a short reassuring message |

## Visual Elements

- **Disproportionate human figures** with tiny heads (1/8 body ratio), impossibly long arms and legs, small hands, narrow shoulders — the defining visual signature of the style
- **Flat color fills with zero texture** — no brush strokes, no grain, no paper texture, perfectly smooth vector fills
- **Unrealistic skin colors** — figures rendered in purple, blue, yellow, or teal skin as a diversity signal, alongside more naturalistic brown tones
- **Blobby organic shapes** floating in the background — amorphous amoeba-like forms in pale accent colors, serving no purpose except to fill space
- **Minimal or no facial features** — dot eyes, no mouth, or just a simple curved smile line. No detailed expressions, no wrinkles, no character
- **Oversized objects as props** — enormous phones, laptops, pencils, lightbulbs held by or interacted with by the small-headed figures
- **Gentle gradients** — very subtle color transitions in backgrounds, nothing dramatic, everything soft and unthreatening
- **Abstract geometric accents** — circles, triangles, squiggles, and plus signs scattered decoratively, contributing nothing semantically
- **Seated and standing poses** — figures sitting cross-legged on invisible floors, standing with one hand raised, leaning on oversized objects
- **Collaborative group scenes** — 3-5 figures arranged together performing teamwork activities, always diverse in skin tone and hair, always harmonious
- **Potted plants** — small decorative houseplants appearing in nearly every scene, the universal corporate-Memphis prop
- **NO shadows or very subtle shadows** — if present, just a soft colored blob beneath figures, never realistic cast shadows
- **NO outlines on figures** — shapes defined by color fill edges meeting, not by drawn lines
- **Aspirational activities** — people high-fiving, planting seeds, riding rockets, building towers of blocks, meditating, doing yoga

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Stacked platforms with figures standing at different heights, connected by ladders or stairs | SaaS pricing page tiers |
| Flow/process | Figures passing objects along a horizontal chain, each figure performing the next step | Onboarding flow illustration |
| Connections | Figures linked by dotted lines or abstract curved paths, each figure in their own colored circle | Team collaboration diagram |
| Cycles | Figures arranged in a circle, each performing a different activity, arrows connecting them | Agile sprint cycle illustration |
| Comparison | Two scenes side by side — "before" in muted grays, "after" in full corporate-Memphis color | Product transformation story |
| Categories | Grid of individual figures each holding a different oversized prop representing their category | Feature grid on a landing page |
| Growth | Ascending staircase of blocks with figures climbing, the topmost figure planting a flag or reaching for a star | Growth metrics visualization |
| Networks | Central figure connected by lines to surrounding figures in a hub-and-spoke layout | Org chart or integration map |
| Hero Scene | Large central illustration with multiple figures collaborating on a single oversized object (building a website, painting a canvas) | Homepage hero section |
| Empty State | Single isolated figure in a calm pose with a brief text message | Empty inbox, no results, first-time user |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Corporate Memphis Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Data/information | Oversized bar charts, pie charts, or screens that figures interact with — standing on top of chart bars, pointing at screens |
| Processes | Assembly line of figures each performing one task, passing an abstract object forward |
| Systems | Interconnected gears, blocks, or puzzle pieces that figures are assembling together |
| Connections | Dotted lines or curved paths linking figures, each person in their own colored bubble |
| Growth | A figure watering a potted plant that grows progressively taller, or climbing an ascending staircase |
| Time | A horizontal timeline with figures at different points, each in a different pose or activity |
| Hierarchy | Stacked platforms of increasing height, figures standing at different levels |
| Protection | A figure holding an oversized shield or umbrella over smaller figures or objects |
| Speed | A figure riding a rocket, surfing on a lightning bolt, or running with motion lines |
| Stability | A figure sitting calmly in a meditation pose, or standing solidly on a large geometric block |
| Users/people | The generic long-limbed figures themselves — interchangeable, diverse in surface features, identical in personality |
| Ideas | A figure with an oversized lightbulb overhead, or holding a glowing star |
| Energy | A figure in a dynamic pose (jumping, dancing) surrounded by small geometric accents (stars, circles, squiggles) |
| Collaboration | Multiple figures lifting or building something together, hands touching the same object |
| Security | A figure standing behind an oversized lock or inside a shield outline |
| Communication | Figures with oversized speech bubbles, megaphones, or sending paper airplanes |

## Typography

- Clean geometric sans-serif — Inter, Circular, Product Sans, or similar tech-company typefaces
- Medium weight for body text, bold for headlines — never thin, never ultra-heavy
- Generous letter-spacing and line-height — everything airy and breathable
- Left-aligned body text with centered headlines — standard tech landing page layout
- Headlines in deep indigo or dusty purple; body in charcoal blue
- Occasional accent words in coral or teal for emphasis
- NO serif fonts, NO display fonts, NO handwritten fonts — everything is clean, neutral, and inoffensive
- Button text in white on colored rounded-rectangle buttons
- Subheadings often in a lighter color than headlines, creating a soft visual hierarchy

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT Memphis Design (Sottsass/1980s)** — despite sharing the word "Memphis," these are completely different aesthetics. True Memphis Design uses thick black outlines, clashing neon colors, zigzag patterns, terrazzo textures, and deliberate visual anarchy. Corporate Memphis uses soft pastels, no outlines, smooth blobs, and deliberate visual blandness. They are opposites.
- **NOT editorial illustration** — editorial illustration has personality, point of view, artistic voice, and visual wit. Corporate Memphis is deliberately generic, interchangeable, and devoid of individual artistic identity. If the illustration has something interesting to say, it is not corporate Memphis.
- **NOT character design** — corporate Memphis figures are not characters. They have no personality, no specific identity, no memorable features. If you can tell the figures apart by anything other than hair and skin color, it is too distinctive.
- **NOT pixel art or retro** — corporate Memphis is slick, modern, vector-based. No pixelation, no retro texture, no nostalgia.
- **NOT Bauhaus** — Bauhaus is systematic, geometric, and intellectually rigorous. Corporate Memphis is decorative filler designed to make software feel "human."
- **NOT realistic illustration** — no anatomical accuracy, no perspective, no realistic lighting. Everything is flat, simplified, and deliberately non-specific.
- **NOT line illustration** — corporate Memphis figures are defined by filled shapes, not drawn outlines. If there are visible outlines defining forms, it is a different style.
- This must look like a Slack or Notion landing page illustration — long-limbed blobby figures in muted pastels performing vaguely aspirational activities against soft gradient backgrounds with floating abstract shapes — not an artistic illustration that happens to use flat colors.

## Best For

Tech product explainers, SaaS landing pages, onboarding flows, app empty states, startup pitch decks, HR and workplace culture content, diversity and inclusion materials, fintech and insurtech communications, B2B marketing, product feature highlights, anything that needs to feel approachable, modern, and professionally inoffensive without making any specific aesthetic commitment.
