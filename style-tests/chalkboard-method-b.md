# chalkboard

White and colored chalk on a dark green or black slate surface — the aesthetic of a professor's lecture board mid-derivation, a coffee-shop sandwich board on a rainy sidewalk, a farmhouse kitchen menu scrawled in a practiced hand. Lines glow with chalky texture against the dark ground, dust ghosts of erased previous lessons linger beneath fresh strokes, hand-drawn arrows and underlines carry the casual authority of someone who truly understands their subject. This is Richard Feynman's physics lectures at Caltech, the specials board at a Brooklyn bistro, a schoolroom in a Wes Anderson film — knowledge made tangible through the most democratic of drawing surfaces, where imperfection is authenticity and the eraser smudge proves something was learned.

## Color Palette

- Background: Dark chalkboard green (#2C3E2D), slate black (#1A1A2E), worn blackboard (#252530) — the dark ground is the defining element, slightly mottled with cleaning ghosts and tonal variation, never flat digital black
- Primary chalk: Warm white (#F0EDE4) — not pure #FFFFFF but a soft, slightly yellow chalk white with visible texture and density variation. Strokes are opaque at center, feathered and dusty at edges
- Colored chalks: Pastel yellow (#F5E6A3), dusty pink (#E8A0A0), sky blue (#A0C4E8), soft green (#A0D4A0), pale orange (#F0C090), lavender (#C0A8D0) — all muted and chalky, never saturated or neon. These are sticks of compressed pigment, not digital color
- Accent: Bright white for emphasis and underlines — pressed harder, thicker, more opaque than standard chalk marks
- Ghost/erasure: Faint gray-green (#4A5A4A) smudges where previous content was wiped away — the palimpsest of erased lessons showing through
- Text: All in chalk — white for primary, yellow for highlights, pink or blue for secondary emphasis. Never digital font; always hand-drawn lettering

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Classic Lecture | Dark green board + white chalk only — pure, authoritative, the Feynman lecture. All information hierarchy achieved through stroke weight and size, not color |
| Bistro Menu | Slate black board + white chalk + pastel yellow headings + pink accent flourishes — the artisan restaurant specials board, warm and inviting |
| Colorful Classroom | Dark green board + white primary + yellow, pink, blue, and green chalk for categories — the elementary-school teacher who uses color to organize |
| Neon Chalk | Near-black board (#151520) + bright pastel chalks (all colors) glowing against the dark — the Korean chalk art trend, maximum chalk color variety |
| Erased Palimpsest | Green board with heavy erasure ghosts + fresh white chalk layered over faded previous content — the lecture hall at 4pm, third class of the day |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Lecture** | Mathematical derivations, diagrams, and explanations with professional authority | Equations, arrows, boxed results, underlined conclusions, marginal annotations. The organized chaos of a physicist's blackboard — content flows in a logical but not gridded arrangement. Erasure marks where the professor backed up and corrected. Chalk dust accumulation at the bottom |
| **Bistro** | Decorative hand-lettered menu or announcement with artisan warmth | Careful hand lettering with flourishes, decorative borders of chalk vines or stars, menu items with prices, ornamental dividers. More deliberate and artistic than lecture — someone spent time on this. Banner ribbons, laurel wreaths, small illustrations of food items |
| **Sketch** | Loose freehand diagrams, flowcharts, and concept maps | Quick confident strokes, arrows connecting ideas, circles around key concepts, dashed lines for uncertain connections, question marks. The brainstorming session captured mid-thought. Speed over precision, energy over polish |
| **Classroom** | Colorful organized teaching with clear structure | Neatly segmented board areas (date in corner, topic centered, content below), color-coded categories, numbered lists, star stickers drawn in chalk, the careful hand of a teacher who organizes for clarity |

## Visual Elements

- **Chalky stroke texture with pressure variation** — strokes thicker and more opaque where pressed hard, thinner and grainier where the chalk barely touches the surface. Edges are never sharp; they have the granular softness of calcium carbonate on slate. This texture is the single most critical element
- **Dark mottled board surface** — not a flat solid color but a subtly uneven surface with cleaning streaks, tonal variation, and the slight sheen of a well-used slate. The surface has history and depth
- **Erasure ghosts and chalk dust smudges** — faint remnants of previously erased content visible beneath fresh marks. Smudged areas where a hand or sleeve brushed the surface. The palimpsest effect: layers of knowledge, never fully erased
- **Hand-drawn lettering with personality** — every word written by hand, with natural baseline wobble, variable letter spacing, and individual character to each letterform. Some letters connect, some stand alone, sizing is approximate and human
- **Underlines and emphasis marks** — double underlines beneath key words, wavy underlines for emphasis, circled words for critical concepts, stars and asterisks for footnotes. The annotation vocabulary of a working board
- **Hand-drawn arrows in multiple styles** — straight arrows with open heads, curved arrows showing flow, looping arrows showing cycles, dashed arrows showing uncertain relationships. Arrows are the connective tissue of chalkboard communication
- **Boxed and bordered results** — important conclusions enclosed in hand-drawn rectangles (corners not quite meeting), double-bordered for extra emphasis. The visual equivalent of "this is the answer"
- **Chalk dust accumulation at the board's bottom edge** — a subtle brightening of the dark surface along the lower margin where fallen chalk dust settles. This grounds the composition in physical reality
- **Numbered and bulleted lists** — circled numbers or hand-drawn bullet points (dots, dashes, stars) organizing sequential information. The natural list-making vocabulary of chalkboard teaching
- **Simple line-drawn diagrams and illustrations** — not detailed art, but confident quick sketches: a coffee cup in five strokes, a lightbulb as a circle with rays, a human figure as a stick person. Iconic, not illustrative
- **Dashed and dotted lines** — dashes for invisible connections or uncertain relationships, dotted lines for boundaries or groupings. Multiple line styles creating visual hierarchy
- **Mathematical and symbolic notation** — plus signs, equals signs, arrows, brackets, braces used as visual grammar even in non-mathematical content. The symbolic language of explanation
- **NO digital precision, NO straight lines, NO uniform spacing** — everything is drawn by hand on a physical surface. If lines are perfectly straight or letters are perfectly uniform, it looks printed, not chalked
- **NO photographs, NO gradients, NO transparency effects** — this is chalk on slate. The only gradient is the natural density variation within a chalk stroke

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Largest text at top center (topic/title), supporting content organized below in decreasing size, key results boxed at bottom | Classic lecture board — title, derivation, conclusion boxed at the bottom with "IMPORTANT" underlined |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right arrow chain with circled step numbers, each step a small diagram or label connected by bold chalk arrows | Feynman diagram methodology — step 1 leads to step 2 leads to result |
| Connections | Hand-drawn mind map — central concept circled, radiating lines to related concepts, each with its own small annotations | Brainstorming session board — central question with branching explorations |
| Cycles | Circular arrow arrangement — four or five concepts arranged in a rough circle connected by curved arrows, the cycle reading clockwise | Biology class: water cycle, carbon cycle — the circular process drawn as a loop |
| Comparison | Board divided by a vertical chalk line — left side labeled "A", right side labeled "B", parallel attributes listed for comparison | Debate prep board — pros on one side, cons on the other, divided by a chalk line |
| Categories | Color-coded sections — each category in a different chalk color, separated by dashed chalk borders, with category names as headers | Classroom organization — "Vocabulary" in yellow, "Grammar" in pink, "Homework" in blue |
| Growth | Ascending staircase of blocks or bars drawn in chalk, each taller than the last, labeled at base, with a diagonal trend arrow | Economics class — bar chart of GDP growth drawn freehand with a rising trend line |
| Timeline | Horizontal line with tick marks and dates, events labeled above and below the line alternating, arrows pointing to key moments | History class timeline — a chalk line across the board with hanging event descriptions |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Chalkboard Metaphor |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Data/information | Chalked numbers and tally marks — data as handwritten figures, proportional sizing for emphasis. A big "42%" written large and underlined = important data |
| Processes | Arrow chains connecting circled step numbers — the step-by-step explanation, each arrow a "therefore" or "leads to" |
| Systems | Mind map with central hub and radiating connections — the system as a hand-drawn network of circled concepts linked by chalk lines |
| Connections | Hand-drawn lines and arrows linking circled concepts — physical chalk strokes connecting ideas across the board |
| Growth | Ascending hand-drawn bar chart or staircase — each step taller, trend arrow rising diagonally, numbers getting bigger |
| Time | Horizontal timeline with tick marks, dates, and hanging event labels — time as a line drawn across the board |
| Hierarchy | Size and position — biggest text at top, most important results boxed and double-underlined, supporting details smaller and marginal |
| Protection | Double-bordered box around critical content — a chalk fortress protecting the conclusion from erasure |
| Speed | Multiple arrows in sequence, dashed lines suggesting rapid connection, exclamation marks for urgency |
| Stability | Heavily drawn, thick-stroked foundational elements at the bottom of the board — the base of the explanation |
| Users/people | Simple stick figures — circle head, line body, angled limbs. Expressive despite extreme simplicity (raised arms = success, drooping = sad) |
| Ideas | Lightbulb drawn in chalk (circle + rays), or star burst, or exclamation mark — the universal "eureka" symbols |
| Energy | Multiple exclamation marks, underlines, larger text, colored chalk emphasis — the board equivalent of raising your voice |
| Tension/conflict | Two opposing arrows meeting head-on, or a versus ("VS") in large chalk between two boxed concepts |

## Typography

- ALL hand-drawn lettering — every single character written as if by a real hand holding a real stick of chalk on a real board. Baseline wobble, variable sizing, natural character spacing, and individual personality in each letter
- Mixed case with natural emphasis — titles in larger, bolder chalk strokes (pressed harder), body text in smaller, lighter strokes. Size variation achieved through chalk pressure, not font selection
- Key words in colored chalk — a yellow word in a white sentence, a pink-underlined term, blue annotations in the margin. Color for emphasis, not decoration
- Circled, boxed, and underlined words for emphasis hierarchy: underline = important, box = critical, double-box = the final answer, circle = definition or key term
- Numbers written large and confident — "3 STEPS" in big bold chalk, step numbers in drawn circles
- Arrows and connective marks as typographic elements — "Step 1 --> Step 2 --> Step 3" uses the arrow as punctuation
- NO digital fonts of any kind — not even "handwriting fonts." The text must look genuinely chalked: irregular, textured, pressure-varying, slightly dusty at the edges
- NO perfectly horizontal baselines, NO uniform letter width, NO kern-perfect spacing — every word should look like it was written in real time by a human hand on a vertical surface

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT a dark-mode UI with handwriting fonts** — the chalkboard texture, dust, erasure ghosts, and chalk pressure variation are not optional decoration. A dark background with white "handwriting font" text is a dark-mode website, not a chalkboard. The physical surface must be convincingly present.
- **NOT patent-drawing or technical illustration** — patent drawings are precise, ruled, and clinical on white backgrounds. Chalkboard is loose, hand-drawn, and warm on dark surfaces. If it looks precise and engineered, it is a patent drawing.
- **NOT sumi-e or ink painting** — sumi-e uses wet ink brush on paper with washes and bleeds. Chalkboard uses dry chalk on slate with grain and dust. The media are opposites: wet vs. dry, paper vs. slate, ink vs. chalk. If strokes look wet or washy, it is wrong.
- **NOT matsumoto or sketch-style illustration** — those styles use ink and watercolor on paper with urban subject matter and artistic expression. Chalkboard is educational, informational, and presentational. If it tells a narrative story with characters, it is illustration, not chalkboard.
- **NOT neon signage** — neon glows with smooth, even light against dark backgrounds. Chalk is matte, granular, and textured against matte, granular surfaces. If the white lines glow or have light-bloom effects, it is neon, not chalk.
- **NOT vintage typography poster** — vintage posters use printed typefaces, registration marks, and ink-on-paper textures. Chalkboard uses hand-drawn lettering with chalk-on-slate textures. If the text looks typeset rather than written, it is a poster.
- **NOT minimalist** — a chalkboard in use is full of content, annotations, arrows, underlines, margin notes, and erasure ghosts. A nearly-empty dark surface with a few clean white words is minimalist design, not chalkboard. Fill the board as a teacher fills a lecture.
- This must look like a photograph of an actual chalkboard in a classroom, bistro, or lecture hall — dark green or black slate surface with visible grain and cleaning streaks, real chalk texture in every stroke, dust accumulation at the bottom, erasure smudges in the background, and the unmistakable warmth of knowledge shared by hand.

## Best For

Educational content, step-by-step tutorials, how-to guides, recipe instructions, process explanations, brainstorming and ideation, menu-style listings, comparison charts, anything that benefits from the warmth and authority of hand-drawn explanation — the feeling that a knowledgeable person stood at a board and walked you through it in person.
