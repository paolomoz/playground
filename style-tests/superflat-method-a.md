# superflat

Ultra-flat, boundary-dissolving Japanese pop art where anime, otaku culture, and fine art collide in a single depthless plane — dense fields of grinning cartoon flowers, eyeball motifs, and candy-colored skulls tiled across the entire canvas with zero negative space. Every surface is filled to saturation with crisp vector-sharp shapes, black outlines of uniform weight, and colors cranked to maximum chroma, producing infographics that look like a Takashi Murakami painting merged with a Sanrio product catalog: joyful, overwhelming, and deliberately flattened into a single pictorial plane with no horizon, no shadow, and no atmospheric depth.

## Variants
| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Flower Field | Dense tiling of smiling flower faces covering entire background, content panels float on top | Repeating daisy-like flowers with round petal rings surrounding a grinning face, every flower slightly different color |
| Jellyfish Eyes | Organic biomorphic creatures with large round eyes scattered across canvas as decorative field | Soft blobby creatures with oversized eyes, translucent overlapping forms, psychedelic color shifts |
| DOB Character | Bold mascot character dominates composition, sharp teeth, round ears, wide grin | Central cartoon figure with Mickey-Mouse-like ears and shark-toothed grin, surrounded by radiating color fields |
| Cosmos | Concentric radiating rings of color and pattern emanating from center, mandala-like symmetry | Rainbow target-like rings filled with micro-pattern — tiny skulls, eyes, flowers — expanding outward |

## Visual Elements
- **Smiling flower faces tiled across entire background**: Round flowers with 8-12 rounded petals arranged in a ring, each flower containing a simple smiling face (two dot eyes, curved mouth) in its center disk — flowers packed edge-to-edge with NO gaps between them
- **Absolute flatness — zero depth cues**: Every element exists on a single plane. No perspective lines, no size-based depth, no overlapping that suggests spatial recession. Background and foreground are the same plane
- **Uniform black outlines on all shapes**: Every flower, character, icon, and text container is enclosed by a consistent 2-3px black outline with no variation in weight, perfectly crisp and vector-clean
- **Maximum color saturation across the entire canvas**: Every color is at full chroma — no pastels (unless bubblegum pink field), no earth tones, no desaturation. Colors scream at equal volume
- **Eyeball motifs as decorative elements**: Standalone round eyes with colored irises and black pupils scattered among flowers and patterns, staring directly at viewer
- **Skull motifs rendered cute**: Rounded cartoon skulls with oversized eye sockets, no menace, treated as cheerful decorative elements equal in visual weight to flowers
- **Mushroom forms with dotted caps**: Rounded cartoon mushrooms with spotted dome caps, simple stems, grinning faces, scattered as repeating motifs
- **NO negative space — every square millimeter is filled**: Background is not empty. It is a dense tiled pattern of flowers, eyes, skulls, stars, or concentric color rings. There is no breathing room
- **Rainbow gradient rings as structural halos**: Concentric circles of spectral color (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-violet) radiating outward from key elements, each ring a flat solid color band
- **Cartoon characters with sharp-toothed grins**: Round-headed mascot figures with oversized mouths full of pointed triangular teeth, round ears, and simplified limbs — cheerful despite the teeth
- **Star and sparkle shapes as filler motifs**: Four-pointed and six-pointed stars in various sizes scattered to fill any remaining gaps between larger elements
- **Flat solid color fields with hard edges**: Where background patterns give way to content zones, the transition is a hard-edged shape boundary, never a fade or gradient
- **Repeating micro-patterns within shapes**: Larger shapes may be filled not with a single color but with a tiny repeating pattern (mini flowers, mini eyes, mini stars) at reduced scale
- **Bilateral symmetry in overall composition**: Many compositions mirror left-to-right or radiate from center, reflecting mandala and decorative textile patterns

| Balance | Two sides of a symmetrical composition with equal density of flowers and motifs, mirrored across a central vertical axis |
| Collaboration | Multiple mascot characters overlapping in a group, each a different saturated color, all sharing one continuous grin |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Bold rounded sans-serif with soft terminals — Rounded Mplus, Varela Round, Nunito Black; letterforms must feel bubbly and pop-inflected, matching the rounded organic shapes of the flowers
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS in extra-bold weight, filled with a single flat saturated color, outlined in black matching illustration line weight; often placed inside a rounded rectangle or pill shape with contrasting fill; 28-40pt equivalent
- **Body Labels**: Sentence case, bold weight, 12-16pt equivalent, always inside a rounded container (pill shape, circle, rounded rectangle) with flat color fill and black outline — NEVER floating freely
- **Number Callouts**: Bold numerals inside small circles with colored fills and black outlines, matching the style of flower centers
- **Emphasis Words**: May be rendered in alternating colors per letter (R-E-D, B-L-U-E style) for decorative effect within titles
- **NO serif typefaces, NO thin weights, NO condensed faces**: Everything is round, bold, and bubbly
- **NO text with gradients, 3D effects, or bevels**: Text is flat color with flat outline, same as every other element

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO empty space, NO negative space, NO breathing room**: The canvas must be FILLED. If you can see bare background, add more flowers, more eyes, more stars. **Superflat abhors a vacuum — FILL EVERY GAP**
- **NO gradients of any kind — NOT in fills, NOT in backgrounds, NOT in any shape**: Every color region is a single flat value at maximum saturation. Gradients are antithetical to the flat philosophy. **NO GRADIENTS. Repeat: NO GRADIENTS**
- **NO shadows, NO drop shadows, NO cast shadows, NO ambient occlusion**: There is no light source. There is no depth. There are no shadows. **ZERO shadows**
- **NO perspective, NO vanishing points, NO foreshortening**: Everything is flat. A cup seen from above is a circle. A building is a flat facade. There is no 3D spatial recession. **NO DEPTH CUES**
- **NO muted colors, NO earth tones, NO desaturated palettes**: Do NOT use brown, olive, mauve, dusty rose, sage green, or any color that looks like it belongs in a farmhouse kitchen. **MAXIMUM CHROMA ONLY**
- **NO realistic rendering, NO photographic textures, NO naturalistic proportions**: This is cartoon pop art. Flowers have faces. Skulls are cute. Everything is simplified to graphic shapes. **NO REALISM**
- **NO Western comic book style**: Do NOT use dramatic foreshortening, muscular figures, heavy black spotting, or chiaroscuro. This is Japanese pop-flat, not Marvel/DC
- **NO Art Nouveau curves, NO organic flowing lines**: Despite the flower motifs, shapes are geometrically round (circles, ovals) not organically sinuous. Petals are uniform rounded lobes, not flowing tendrils
- **NO watercolor, NO painterly texture, NO visible brushstrokes**: Edges are vector-crisp. Fills are perfectly uniform. There is no hand-painted quality
- **NO sparse minimal compositions**: Do NOT create a single icon centered on white space. Superflat is DENSE. If it looks like a Swiss design poster, you have failed. **MORE DENSITY**
- **NO glow effects, NO lens flare, NO bloom, NO neon light emission**: Bright colors are achieved through flat saturation, not through rendered luminosity effects
- **NO realistic eyes or faces on characters**: Eyes are simple dots or circles. Mouths are simple curves or triangle-teeth grins. Do NOT draw anatomically correct faces. **KEEP IT CARTOON**
- **NO single focal point with empty surroundings**: The entire canvas is the focal point. Every region is equally dense, equally saturated, equally active. **ALL-OVER COMPOSITION**
