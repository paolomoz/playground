# de-stijl

Strict geometric abstraction reduced to the absolute essentials: horizontal and vertical black lines forming a grid, rectangles filled exclusively with primary red, primary blue, primary yellow, pure white, or pure black — nothing else. Inspired by Piet Mondrian's neoplastic paintings and Theo van Doesburg's typographic experiments, every composition is a precisely balanced asymmetric arrangement of rectangular cells where no diagonal, no curve, and no secondary color is permitted. Infographics become architectural compositions of pure orthogonal relationships, where information lives inside colored rectangles separated by bold black bars, achieving harmony through proportion rather than decoration.

## Color Palette
- Primary: Pure red `#FF0000`, pure blue `#0000FF`, pure yellow `#FFD700` (warm cadmium yellow)
- Background: Pure white `#FFFFFF`
- Structure: Pure black `#000000` for all grid lines, borders, and text
- **ONLY these five values exist in De Stijl**: red, blue, yellow, white, black. No other colors. Period.

### Palette Combinations
| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Mondrian Classic | Red `#FF0000` + blue `#0000FF` + yellow `#FFD700` + white `#FFFFFF` + black `#000000` grid — all five present, white dominant |
| Red Dominant | Large red `#FF0000` rectangle + small blue `#0000FF` accent + yellow `#FFD700` strip + white `#FFFFFF` fields + black `#000000` grid |
| Blue Dominant | Large blue `#0000FF` rectangle + small red `#FF0000` accent + yellow `#FFD700` strip + white `#FFFFFF` fields + black `#000000` grid |
| Minimal Mondrian | White `#FFFFFF` dominant with black `#000000` grid + single small red `#FF0000` rectangle + single small yellow `#FFD700` rectangle, no blue |

## Variants
| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Broadway Boogie-Woogie | Grid lines themselves become sequences of small colored squares (red, yellow, blue) instead of solid black | Pulsing rhythmic grid where the black bars are replaced by dotted color sequences |
| Neoplastic Classic | Thick black grid with asymmetric rectangles of primary color and white, Mondrian's signature 1930s compositions | Bold black lines (8-12px), large white fields, strategically placed color blocks |
| Rietveld Spatial | Three-dimensional extrusion of the grid into overlapping rectangular planes, as in the Red-Blue Chair | Colored rectangles appear to overlap at edges, suggesting planar depth while remaining strictly orthogonal |
| Van Doesburg Diagonal | Counter-composition where the entire grid is rotated 45 degrees while maintaining strict horizontal-vertical internal relationships | Diamond-oriented canvas with the same rectangular grid rules, creating dynamic tension |

## Visual Elements
- **Bold black horizontal and vertical lines forming an asymmetric grid**: Lines are uniformly thick (8-12px equivalent), perfectly straight, meeting at right angles only — forming rectangles of varying proportions across the entire canvas
- **Rectangles filled with ONLY primary red, primary blue, primary yellow, or white**: Each cell of the grid contains exactly one flat fill — pure red `#FF0000`, pure blue `#0000FF`, pure yellow `#FFD700`, or white `#FFFFFF`. NO other colors exist
- **Asymmetric balance through proportion**: No two adjacent rectangles are the same size. Large white fields balance small intense color blocks. The composition feels balanced WITHOUT being symmetrical
- **Black lines extend to canvas edges**: Grid lines run from edge to edge of the canvas — they do NOT stop in the middle, they do NOT form closed internal shapes that float. Every line touches at least two edges
- **White as the dominant field color**: Most of the canvas area is white. Color rectangles (red, blue, yellow) are accent areas occupying perhaps 20-35% of total area, strategically placed for visual weight
- **No curves anywhere — zero rounded shapes**: Every shape is a rectangle with 90-degree corners. Every line is perfectly straight. There are no circles, no arcs, no ellipses, no curves of any kind
- **No diagonals — strictly horizontal and vertical**: No line deviates from perfect horizontal or perfect vertical. No shape is rotated. No element is placed at an angle (except in the Van Doesburg diagonal variant where the entire canvas rotates)
- **Text placed inside grid cells**: Labels and titles occupy their own rectangular grid cells, treated as content blocks equal in importance to color blocks
- **Grid lines have uniform thickness**: Every black line in the composition is the same width — no thin accent lines, no thick emphasis lines, just one consistent heavy black bar throughout
- **Color blocks are completely flat**: Each colored rectangle is filled with a single perfectly uniform value — no texture, no pattern, no grain, no variation within the fill
- **Proportional relationships between rectangles create rhythm**: Some cells are tall and narrow, others wide and short, others nearly square — the variety of proportions across the grid creates visual music
- **Black grid lines always overlap/sit on top**: Where lines cross, they maintain their full width — they are structural members like steel beams, not background dividers
- **Rectangles touch grid lines on all sides**: Every colored or white rectangle is fully bounded by black lines or canvas edges — no rectangle floats with space around it

## Compositional Patterns
| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy / Rankings | Largest colored rectangle at top-left for #1, progressively smaller color rectangles descending diagonally, white rectangles between them, all within the black grid | Mondrian's asymmetric size-based hierarchy |
| Process / Timeline | Horizontal sequence of grid cells left-to-right, each step occupying a rectangle — step numbers in small colored squares, content in adjacent white rectangles | Horizontal reading order through grid sections |
| Comparison | Two large rectangular zones separated by a central thick black vertical line, each zone containing its own sub-grid of colored and white cells | Split composition within shared grid |
| Parts of a Whole | Large grid where each category occupies a differently-sized rectangle, proportional area representing percentage of whole, labeled within each cell | Proportional area grid as data visualization |
| Categories / Groups | Regular sub-grid of equal cells, each category assigned one primary color, white cells with black text labels adjacent to colored cells | Color-coded grid classification |
| Geographic / Spatial | Simplified orthogonal map where regions become rectangles in a grid, each region assigned a primary color or white, labeled with place name | Cartographic abstraction into rectangular zones |
| Cause and Effect | Two rectangular zones (left: cause, right: effect) separated by a thick black vertical bar, horizontal arrow formed by a small red rectangle pointing rightward | Sequential reading through grid zones |
| Flow / Cycle | Grid cells numbered in sequence, reading path indicated by small colored squares (red, yellow, blue) placed at transition points between cells | Broadway Boogie-Woogie-style directional rhythm |
| Data Quantities | Bar-chart-like columns within the grid — each column is a tall rectangle whose height represents magnitude, filled with primary color, on white field above black baseline | Neoplastic bar chart in the grid |
| Overview + Detail | One large rectangle (60% of grid area) for overview, remaining grid cells subdivided into smaller rectangles for supporting details | Dominant cell with subordinate cells |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings
| Abstract Concept | De Stijl Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Growth | A sequence of three rectangles within the grid, each taller than the last, progressing from yellow (small) to red (medium) to blue (large) |
| Speed / Velocity | A long horizontal red rectangle spanning nearly the full width of the grid, narrow and fast, with small yellow squares at its leading edge |
| Connection | Two colored rectangles (one red, one blue) sharing a common black grid line — they are connected by the structural line between them |
| Danger / Risk | A red rectangle larger than all others in the composition, dominating the upper area, creating visual tension through disproportionate weight |
| Discovery | A small yellow rectangle in an otherwise white-dominant grid — the eye finds it because it is the only warm accent in a field of cool and neutral |
| Money / Cost | A yellow rectangle (gold association) occupying a proportionally significant area of the grid |
| Time | The grid read left-to-right as a timeline, with vertical black lines marking intervals and colored rectangles marking events at those intervals |
| Security / Protection | A thick black grid with narrow cells — the dense structural framework itself represents protective enclosure |
| Communication | Two colored rectangles of equal size placed at opposite corners of the grid, the network of black lines between them forming the communication channel |
| Global / International | The entire grid as a world map — large rectangles for major regions, small rectangles for smaller ones, each assigned a primary color |
| Complexity | A densely subdivided grid with many small rectangles of varying proportions, more divisions in one area indicating greater complexity |
| Innovation | A single colored rectangle breaking the otherwise regular rhythm of the grid — slightly different proportion that draws the eye |
| Balance | The entire composition IS balance — asymmetric arrangement of unequal rectangles achieving perfect visual equilibrium through proportion |
| Collaboration | Red, blue, and yellow rectangles of equal area placed in a triangular arrangement within the grid, each contributing equally to the whole |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Strict geometric sans-serif with rectangular letterforms — Futura, DIN, or Univers; letters must feel like they belong inside the grid, constructed from straight horizontal and vertical strokes
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS in bold weight, black `#000000` on white `#FFFFFF` rectangle, or white reversed out of a black or primary-color rectangle; 28-36pt equivalent; the title occupies its own grid cell
- **Body Labels**: ALL CAPS or sentence case, regular to bold weight, 10-14pt equivalent, always inside a grid cell — either black text on white cell or white text on colored cell
- **Number Callouts**: Bold numerals in black inside small white grid cells, or white numerals inside small colored grid cells (red for emphasis, blue for secondary, yellow for tertiary)
- **Grid-Aligned Text**: All text baselines align with horizontal grid lines. All text left-edges align with vertical grid lines. Text respects the orthogonal structure absolutely
- **NO decorative typefaces, NO serif typefaces, NO script typefaces**: Only geometric sans-serif is permitted
- **NO text outside the grid**: Every piece of text lives inside a rectangular cell bounded by black lines

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO colors beyond red, blue, yellow, white, and black**: Do NOT use green, orange, purple, pink, brown, gray, teal, or ANY secondary/tertiary color. **ONLY FIVE VALUES EXIST: red #FF0000, blue #0000FF, yellow #FFD700, white #FFFFFF, black #000000**
- **NO gradients of any kind**: Every rectangle is a single perfectly flat color. No color transitions, no fades, no ombre effects. **NO GRADIENTS — ABSOLUTE ZERO**
- **NO curves, NO circles, NO rounded corners, NO arcs, NO ellipses**: Every shape is a rectangle with 90-degree corners. Every line is straight. **If it is not a rectangle or a straight line, it does not belong. NO CURVES WHATSOEVER**
- **NO diagonals**: No line runs at any angle other than 0 or 90 degrees. No shapes are rotated. No elements are tilted. **STRICTLY HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL ONLY**
- **NO shadows, NO drop shadows, NO depth effects, NO 3D**: The composition is perfectly flat. There is no light source, no depth, no layering. **ZERO SHADOWS, ZERO DEPTH**
- **NO figurative imagery, NO illustrations of objects, NO icons, NO pictograms**: De Stijl is pure geometric abstraction. Do NOT draw coffee cups, people, arrows (curved), trees, or any representational imagery. **ONLY RECTANGLES AND LINES**
- **NO decorative elements, NO ornaments, NO borders beyond the grid**: No flourishes, no patterns within rectangles, no textured fills, no halftones, no dots. **RECTANGLES OF FLAT COLOR AND BLACK LINES — NOTHING ELSE**
- **NO thin lines mixed with thick lines**: Every black line is the same thickness. Do NOT use hairlines for detail and thick lines for structure. **UNIFORM LINE WEIGHT THROUGHOUT**
- **NO floating elements**: Every rectangle is bounded by grid lines or canvas edges. Nothing floats in space. Nothing has margin or padding that breaks the grid. **EVERYTHING TOUCHES THE GRID**
- **NO symmetrical compositions**: De Stijl achieves balance through ASYMMETRY. Do NOT center elements. Do NOT mirror left-right. Do NOT create symmetrical grids. **ASYMMETRIC BALANCE IS MANDATORY**
- **NO organic shapes, NO natural forms, NO biomorphic curves**: No leaves, no waves, no clouds, no flowing forms. **PURE GEOMETRY ONLY**
- **NO texture, NO grain, NO paper effects, NO noise**: Surfaces are perfectly smooth, perfectly flat, perfectly uniform. **CLINICAL PERFECTION**
- **NO photographic elements, NO realistic rendering**: This is geometric abstraction. Do NOT incorporate photographs or photorealistic elements of any kind
