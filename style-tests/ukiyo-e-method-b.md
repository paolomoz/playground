# ukiyo-e

Japanese woodblock print aesthetic from the Edo period (1603-1868) — bold sumi-ink outlines containing flat areas of saturated color printed in sequential layers, the paper itself showing through as warm cream undertone. Hokusai's Great Wave crashing in Prussian blue with foam-finger spray, Hiroshige's rain slashing diagonally across a bridge of running figures, bijin-ga beauties in layered kimono with patterns within patterns. Colors are opaque and flat within their outlines, never blended. Bokashi gradient appears only in skies and water, where the printer's baren pushed pigment from concentrated edge to bare paper. Every image reads as ink pressed from carved cherry-wood blocks onto mulberry paper — layered, registered, hand-printed.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Hokusai Wave | Deep Prussian blue + white foam + warm paper cream + indigo gradients — the iconic Great Wave palette, dramatic and oceanic |
| Hiroshige Rain | Soft grey-blue sky gradient + indigo rain lines + warm ochre ground + green foliage + figures in vermillion and indigo — atmospheric and melancholy |
| Bijin-ga Elegance | Vermillion red + safflower pink + sumi black + gold accents + white paper showing through + wisteria purple — opulent and refined |
| Nature Seasons | Verdigris green + cherry blossom pink + ochre + indigo + persimmon orange on cream — the four-seasons palette rotating through the year |
| Dramatic Night | Deep Prussian blue filling the sky + sumi black + pale yellow moon + vermillion accent + minimal white highlights — nocturne ukiyo-e |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Hokusai** | Dramatic natural forces, dynamic composition, powerful movement | Towering waves with claw-like foam fingers, bold Mt. Fuji silhouettes, powerful diagonal compositions, Prussian blue dominating, nature as overwhelming force — energy frozen at the moment of maximum tension |
| **Hiroshige** | Serene landscapes, atmospheric depth, weather and mood | Rain rendered as dense parallel diagonal lines across the entire print, mist erasing distant mountains with bokashi fade, figures hunched under umbrellas on bridges, stations of the Tokaido road, evening snow settling gently — nature as atmosphere |
| **Bijin-ga** | Elegant figures, refined decorative detail, fashion and beauty | Beautiful women in elaborately patterned kimono (geometric, floral, wave patterns within the fabric), hair arranged in complex updo with decorative pins, subtle three-quarter poses, interior domestic scenes, refined and intimate |
| **Musha-e (Warriors)** | Dramatic battle scenes, heroic figures, bold dynamic poses | Samurai in elaborate armor with demon-face helmets, swirling robes caught in dramatic wind, weapons drawn at dynamic angles, fierce expressions, waves and flames as background forces — maximum dramatic energy |

## Visual Elements

- **Bold, confident sumi-ink outlines** with varying line weight — thicker outlines for main forms (bodies, buildings, mountains), thinner lines for interior details (fabric folds, facial features, leaf veins). Every shape is bounded by a definitive black line.
- **Flat opaque color areas** with NO gradients within shapes — each color region is a single uniform tone as if printed from one carved block. A blue robe is one flat blue, not a blue that shades darker in folds.
- **Colors appear layered** as if printed in sequential passes — you can sense the registration of one color layer sitting atop another, with the paper cream showing at edges where blocks didn't quite meet perfectly
- **Bokashi gradient effect** in skies and water ONLY — pigment fading from full concentration at one edge to bare paper at the other, created by the printer's hand pressure varying across the block. This is the ONE exception to the flat-color rule.
- **Visible wood-grain texture suggestion** — subtle horizontal or curved line patterns within color areas suggesting the grain of the cherry-wood block transferred to paper during printing
- **Paper texture undertone** — the warm cream of mulberry (washi) paper visible through lighter color areas and in all unprinted regions, giving warmth to the entire composition
- **Stylized wave patterns** — water rendered as rhythmic curling forms with white foam tips, following the Hokusai tradition of waves as grasping clawed hands
- **Cloud patterns (kumo)** as section separators — stylized horizontal bands of cloud rendered as flat shapes with curved tops, separating scene elements vertically
- **Pattern within pattern** — kimono fabrics and architectural screens filled with repeating geometric or floral patterns (asanoha hemp leaf, seigaiha wave, cherry blossom scatter), visible at medium distance
- **Rain as parallel diagonal lines** — precipitation rendered as thin uniform lines slashing diagonally across the ENTIRE composition, in front of all elements, creating visual unity and mood
- **Cartouche title blocks** — rectangular or shaped panels containing the print title in calligraphic text, positioned in the upper area, sometimes with decorative borders
- **Red seal stamps** (publisher, artist, censor marks) positioned at specific locations as authentication — small red rectangular marks with reversed-out white characters
- **Stylized pine, cherry, and bamboo** — trees rendered in the ukiyo-e convention: pine as flat silhouette branches with needle clusters, cherry as delicate blossom masses, bamboo as straight segmented stalks
- **NO soft blending, NO photorealistic rendering, NO 3D perspective with single vanishing point** — depth is created through overlapping flat planes and atmospheric bokashi, not Western perspective

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stacking with stylized cloud bands (kumo) separating layers — most important scene at center, supporting elements above and below, clouds as natural dividers | Mountain landscapes with cloud separators creating distinct registers |
| Flow/process | Strong diagonal movement from lower-left to upper-right, water/path/road motifs carrying the eye through sequential scenes along the journey | Hiroshige's Tokaido road — travelers moving through stations on their journey |
| Connections | Bridges arching over water connecting two shores, boats sailing between islands, cranes flying in V-formation between earth and sky — physical links spanning space | Harbor scenes with bridges as the dominant connecting architecture |
| Cycles | Circular wave patterns, seasonal cherry blossom to autumn leaf progression, moon phases, tidal rhythms — the great wheel of natural time | Hokusai's Great Wave — the endless cycle of water rising and falling |
| Comparison | Side-by-side panels (diptych or triptych format) — the same scene at different times, or two contrasting subjects given equal visual weight | Bijin-ga paired portraits — two beauties, two seasons, two moods |
| Categories | Distinct floating platforms, islands, or architectural spaces each containing a different category — the "floating world" as literal floating zones | Ukiyo (floating world) scenes — each platform an isolated world of its own |
| Growth | Tree growing from seedling bud to full cherry blossom across the composition, or wave building from gentle swell to towering crest | Natural progression expressed through increasing visual complexity |
| Networks | Multiple boats or bridges creating a web of connections across water, or branching pine tree with elements at each branch terminus | Harbor network: boats, docks, bridges, islands all connected across the bay |
| Triptych narrative | Three-panel composition telling a story from left to right — each panel a scene, together creating a panoramic narrative arc | Traditional triptych woodblock series — battle, journey, or landscape unfolding across three joined prints |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Ukiyo-e Metaphor |
|---|---|
| Data/information | Scrolls held by figures, flowing water carrying written messages, stacked books in a scholar's room |
| Processes | Paths, rivers, bridges — the Tokaido road with its 53 stations, each stop a milestone in the journey |
| Systems | Islands connected by bridges and boats, castle compounds with gates linking courtyards, nested architectural spaces |
| Connections | Bridges arching over water (the quintessential ukiyo-e connector), boats under sail between shores, cranes flying in formation |
| Growth | Cherry blossom sequence — tight bud to open flower to falling petal; bamboo shooting upward; seedling pine to ancient twisted trunk |
| Time | Seasons rotating through the composition — spring cherry pink, summer green, autumn persimmon, winter bare branch and snow |
| Hierarchy | Castle tower levels — the tallest keep is the lord, descending roofs are descending rank; mountain height = importance |
| Protection | Castle walls and moats encircling the protected interior, samurai standing guard, mountain ranges as natural fortification |
| Speed | Running horses with legs extended, swift water currents with foam, wind visible through bent trees and flying fabric, Hokusai's dynamic diagonals |
| Stability | Mt. Fuji — the immovable mountain, present in the background of all things, serene above the chaos of waves and weather |
| Users/people | Figures in characteristic Edo-period dress — merchants, courtesans, samurai, travelers — social role visible through costume and posture |
| Ideas | The moon rising — a luminous white or yellow circle in a dark bokashi sky, illuminating the scene below with poetic clarity |
| Energy | Crashing waves, raging fire, swirling wind patterns, battle fury, dragon coils — natural forces rendered as dynamic flat-color patterns |
| Tension/conflict | Storm clouds in dark bokashi, lightning rendered as geometric zigzag, opposing waves clashing, warriors facing each other across diagonal composition |

## Typography

- Brush calligraphy style for titles — bold, flowing sumi-ink strokes with visible brush texture, rendered as if carved into the woodblock and printed
- Clean, readable labels with ink-brush character — each character written with traditional stroke order, distinct and legible
- Text integrated into the composition as vertical cartouche panels, hanging scroll banners, kimono embroidery, shop signage within the scene
- Publisher and series marks in dedicated rectangular cartouche blocks with decorative borders — positioned in upper corners
- Red seal stamps as compositional accents and authentication marks — always present, always vermillion
- Consistent with woodblock printing aesthetic — text appears PRINTED, not handwritten: uniform ink density, clean edges, the quality of ink pressed from carved wood
- NO modern digital fonts, NO horizontal Latin text blocks overwhelming the composition — if Latin alphabet text is needed, integrate it as a label in a small cartouche with Japanese aesthetic framing

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT sumi-e ink painting** — Sumi-e is black ink wash painting with empty space and visible brushwork. Ukiyo-e is PRINTED: flat opaque colors contained by bold outlines, carved from wood blocks, pressed onto paper. They are opposite techniques sharing Japanese origin.
- **NOT anime or manga** — Modern anime uses screen tones, speed lines, exaggerated expressions, and digital coloring. Ukiyo-e uses woodblock flat-color printing, Edo-period subjects, and traditional compositional conventions. Different centuries, different media, different intent.
- **NOT watercolor illustration** — Watercolors are transparent, blended, with soft wet-edge effects. Ukiyo-e pigments are OPAQUE, FLAT, and BOUNDED by outlines. No soft bleeding, no transparency effects, no wet-on-wet mingling.
- **NOT Chinese shan-shui or scroll painting** — Shan-shui uses ink wash gradients and vast empty space (related to sumi-e). Ukiyo-e fills the composition with flat color and decorative pattern — empty space is rare and intentional.
- **NOT Art Nouveau** — Despite both using flowing organic lines, Art Nouveau (Mucha) uses gradient color, metallic effects, and Western female beauty ideals. Ukiyo-e uses flat color, woodblock texture, and Edo-period Japanese aesthetic conventions.
- **NOT generic "Japanese-themed" illustration** — Cherry blossoms and a pagoda in a modern illustration style is not ukiyo-e. The technique (flat color, bold outline, visible printing artifacts, bokashi gradients) is as important as the subject matter.
- **NOT busy Western pattern** — While ukiyo-e contains pattern-within-pattern (kimono fabric), the overall composition reads clearly. It is layered and ordered, not chaotic. Cloud bands, horizon lines, and architectural frames organize the complexity.
- This must look like ink pressed from carved cherry-wood blocks onto handmade mulberry paper — layered flat colors bounded by bold black outlines, with bokashi sky gradients and the warm cream of washi paper visible in unprinted areas — not a digital illustration wearing Japanese motifs as costume.
