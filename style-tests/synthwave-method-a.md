# synthwave

Retro-futuristic 1980s neon aesthetic: a dark purple-blue night sky splits at the horizon into a blazing magenta-to-orange sunset, while a glowing perspective grid floor of thin cyan or magenta lines recedes to a central vanishing point. Chrome-finished text, neon tube outlines, and halftone scan-line overlays evoke VHS tapes, arcade cabinets, and Italo-disco album covers. Every surface pulses with electric glow against an oppressively dark background — information emerges from the void in hot pink, electric blue, and laser purple.

## Variants
| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Outrun | Perspective grid floor vanishing to sunset horizon, palm tree silhouettes, speeding car taillights | Extreme depth via converging grid lines, warm horizon glow bleeding upward, minimal foreground detail |
| Arcade Cabinet | CRT screen curvature, pixel-chunky icons, scanline overlay, coin-slot UI elements | Retro interface frames, thick beveled edges, 8-bit-inspired pictograms rendered in neon glow |
| Chrome Deco | Reflective metallic letterforms, beveled chrome surfaces, geometric Art Deco shapes | Text-dominant, large chrome-finish display type, mirror reflections on flat chrome planes |
| VHS Glitch | Tracking errors, RGB color separation, horizontal distortion bands, tape-wear artifacts | Lo-fi texture overlays, slight misregistration of color channels, warped horizontal bands |

## Visual Elements
- **Perspective grid floor**: A flat plane of thin glowing lines (cyan or magenta) forming a perfect one-point perspective grid that recedes from the bottom edge to a vanishing point at the horizon — lines glow against pure dark background, spacing compresses toward horizon
- **Sunset gradient horizon band**: A horizontal band at the horizon line transitions from deep dark blue at top through purple, then magenta, then orange, to yellow-white at the center — this is the ONLY acceptable gradient in the entire composition and it sits behind the grid
- **Neon tube outlines on every icon and shape**: Objects, containers, and pictograms are outlined with bright glowing neon lines (2-3px core line with soft 8-15px glow bloom extending outward) in magenta, cyan, or purple against dark backgrounds
- **Chrome-finish display text**: Large titles rendered as metallic silver-to-white letterforms with a single horizontal highlight streak across the middle, suggesting polished chrome surfaces — bold, wide, geometric sans-serif or custom display face
- **Palm tree silhouettes**: Tall, thin palm trees rendered as pure black silhouettes against the glowing horizon, placed at left and right edges of the composition as framing devices — NO detail in the silhouettes, just flat black shapes
- **Scanline overlay texture**: Faint horizontal lines spaced 2-3px apart running across the entire image, simulating a CRT monitor or VHS playback — subtle enough to not obscure content but visible enough to add retro texture
- **Glowing geometric shapes**: Triangles, circles, and hexagons rendered as wireframe outlines with neon glow, floating in the dark sky area as decorative cosmic elements — wireframe only, NOT solid filled
- **Neon-lit rectangular content panels**: Information containers are dark translucent rectangles with bright neon border glow (single color per panel), content inside rendered in chrome white or matching neon color
- **Star field in the upper sky**: Tiny white dots scattered in the dark sky area above the sunset, suggesting deep space — dots are small, randomly placed, no constellations or large star shapes
- **Retro car or motorcycle silhouette**: A low-slung sports car (Lamborghini Countach or DeLorean profile) or motorcycle shown in dark silhouette or neon wireframe outline, facing toward the vanishing point on the grid
- **Sun disk at horizon**: A large circle (or horizontally striped circle with gaps, like venetian blinds cutting through it) sitting exactly at the vanishing point, glowing warm orange-magenta, partially below the horizon line
- **Neon sign typography for labels**: Smaller labels rendered as if they are neon tube signs — single continuous glowing line forming each letter, with visible tube bends at corners
- **Glitch/chromatic aberration accents**: Slight red-blue-green color fringing at the edges of key elements, simulating analog video distortion — subtle, 1-3px offset maximum

## Compositional Patterns
| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |

| Speed / Velocity | Neon light trails streaming horizontally from a speeding car silhouette on the grid, elongated cyan streaks dissolving into the vanishing point |
| Connection | A bright laser beam connecting two glowing nodes across the dark void, the beam pulsing with energy, small particles traveling along it |
| Danger / Risk | A glowing red wireframe warning triangle with exclamation mark, flickering with VHS glitch distortion, on a dark background with scan lines |
| Discovery | A glowing neon magnifying glass or binocular HUD overlay with targeting brackets, illuminating a section of the grid in bright cyan |
| Money / Cost | A stack of chrome coins or a neon-outlined dollar sign rendered as a glowing tube sign against the dark sky, reflecting off the grid floor |
| Time | A large neon-outlined clock face with glowing hands, or a digital readout display showing numbers in seven-segment LED style, cyan on black |
| Security / Protection | A glowing wireframe shield shape or hexagonal lock icon in electric cyan, with a neon keyhole at center, scan lines across the surface |
| Communication | Concentric neon arcs radiating outward from a glowing antenna or satellite dish silhouette, arcs in alternating magenta and cyan |
| Global / International | A wireframe globe rendered in glowing cyan grid lines on dark background, rotating on the perspective grid floor, longitude/latitude lines glowing |
| Complexity | A dense tangle of neon circuit-board traces in multiple colors, crisscrossing against dark background, junction points glowing brighter |
| Failure / Error | A shattered neon sign with flickering letters, sparking broken tube segments, glitch distortion bands cutting across the image |
| Innovation | A glowing neon lightbulb outline with radiating beam lines, or a rocket silhouette launching from the grid with neon exhaust trail |
| Balance | A neon wireframe scale or equalizer bars at equal height, symmetrically arranged, glowing cyan against the dark void |
| Collaboration | Two neon-outlined figure silhouettes facing each other across the grid, connected by intertwined glowing energy streams between their hands |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Wide geometric sans-serif with heavy weight — Outrun Future, Blade Runner font, or equivalents like Orbitron, Audiowide, or Rajdhani Bold; letterforms must be angular, wide, and futuristic
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS, extremely wide tracking, chrome metallic finish with a single horizontal specular highlight streak; 32-48pt equivalent; alternatively rendered as neon tube letters with glow bloom; placed prominently against dark sky area
- **Body Labels**: ALL CAPS or small caps in a clean condensed sans-serif (Eurostile, Bank Gothic, Share Tech Mono), 10-14pt equivalent, rendered in chrome white `#E8E8FF` or matching neon glow color, always inside a dark panel with neon border — NEVER floating without a container
- **Number Callouts**: Bold monospaced or seven-segment LED-style numerals inside small neon-bordered circles or hexagons, glowing in cyan or magenta
- **Digital Readout Style**: Secondary data can use monospaced or pixel-font styling to suggest LED/LCD displays — Consolas, VT323, or Press Start 2P aesthetic
- **NO serif typefaces**: No classical, traditional, or organic type — everything is mechanical, digital, futuristic
- **NO flat unlit text**: Every piece of text must appear to glow, reflect, or be chrome — dark matte text is invisible and forbidden on dark backgrounds

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO daylight, NO bright white backgrounds, NO pastel colors**: The world is DARK. Backgrounds are deep navy, indigo, or black-blue. The only light comes from neon glow and the sunset horizon. **If the background is light, it is NOT synthwave**
- **NO flat unlit shapes**: Every visible element either glows with neon light, is a dark silhouette, or has chrome reflective finish. There are NO matte flat-colored objects sitting without glow. **NO flat pastel fills, NO matte cartoon coloring**
- **NO organic hand-drawn lines or brushstrokes**: All lines are clean, geometric, and mechanical. There are NO wobbly outlines, NO watercolor effects, NO painterly textures. **This is machine-made, NOT hand-crafted**
- **NO realistic natural textures**: No wood grain, no grass, no stone texture, no fabric weave. Surfaces are either smooth dark void, glowing neon, chrome metal, or digital grid. **NO nature close-ups, NO organic textures**
- **NO scattered floating decorative elements that don't glow**: Objects in the dark void must be glowing wireframes, neon signs, or silhouettes. Do NOT scatter flat colored confetti, flat icons, or non-glowing clipart. **NO flat floating clipart**
- **NO warm cozy lighting or golden hour**: The light is COLD neon (cyan, magenta, purple) or HOT sunset (orange-magenta at horizon only). There is NO warm incandescent glow, NO candlelight, NO soft golden ambient light
- **NO gradients EXCEPT the sunset horizon band**: The sunset horizon is the one permitted gradient. All other areas use flat dark backgrounds with neon glow effects on top. Do NOT gradient-fill content panels or shapes. **Neon glow bloom is acceptable, color gradients on surfaces are NOT**
- **NO realistic human faces or photographic figures**: People appear as silhouettes, wireframe outlines, or simple geometric avatars. Do NOT render realistic facial features or photographic humans
- **NO crowded busy compositions with too many neon colors**: Maximum 3 neon colors per composition (e.g., cyan + magenta + one accent). Using 6+ neon colors creates visual chaos and loses the moody atmosphere. **Restraint is key — dark space is the canvas**
- **NO cute, whimsical, or childlike elements**: No cartoon animals, no round bubbly shapes, no kawaii faces, no rainbow palettes. Synthwave is slick, angular, and nocturnal
- **NO medieval, rustic, vintage-paper, or handcraft aesthetics**: No parchment textures, no wax seals, no woodcut prints, no letterpress. This is FUTURE, not past
- **NO isometric or axonometric projection**: Synthwave uses dramatic one-point perspective with a vanishing point at the horizon. Do NOT use flat isometric or bird's-eye views
