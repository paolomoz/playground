Precise white lines on deep blueprint blue — the visual language of engineering drawings, patent illustrations, and architectural blueprints where every line has a purpose. Thin leader lines with arrowheads call out dimensions in precise sans-serif numerals. Cross-section views reveal internal structure with diagonal hatching. Dashed lines show hidden edges behind solid surfaces. Center lines alternate long-short-long through axes of symmetry. Everything is orthographic projection — top view, front view, side view — arranged in strict first-angle or third-angle layout with projection lines connecting corresponding features across views. This is the engineer's visual language: no decoration, no artistic license, pure functional communication of how something is built.

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Blueprint** | Classic cyanotype engineering drawing — white on blue | Deep blue background with all geometry in white lines, dimension lines with arrow terminators, text in engineering sans-serif, title block in lower right corner, border with zone markers (A1, B2, C3) |
| **Patent Drawing** | Black ink on white — formal patent illustration style | Precise black outlines on white ground, numbered callout leaders (10, 12, 14) pointing to each feature, cross-hatching for section cuts, multiple orthographic views with "FIG. 1", "FIG. 2" labels, inventor/date block |
| **Exploded View** | Components separated along assembly axes showing how parts fit together | Each part pulled apart along dashed center lines showing assembly order, parts numbered with balloon callouts, alignment arrows showing direction of assembly, hidden edges shown as dashed lines |
| **Cross-Section** | Cut-away view revealing internal structure | Section cut line with arrows showing view direction, exposed interior surfaces filled with diagonal hatching (45-degree parallel lines), different hatch patterns for different materials, hidden geometry shown dashed behind the cut plane |

## Visual Elements

- **Precise uniform-weight lines in white on blue**: Every line is a controlled technical stroke — consistent width, no taper, no variation, no hand-drawn wobble. Lines are the primary and almost only visual element.
- **Dimension lines with arrowhead terminators**: Thin lines running parallel to the measured feature, terminating in sharp arrowheads at each end touching extension lines, with the measurement value (in mm, inches, or abstract units) centered on the dimension line
- **Leader lines with callout labels**: Thin lines with arrowheads pointing FROM numbered circles or text labels TO the feature being identified — the classic engineering annotation method
- **Dashed lines for hidden edges**: Edges that exist but are behind solid surfaces rendered as evenly-spaced short dashes — the universal drafting convention for invisible geometry
- **Center lines as long-short-long dash patterns**: Axes of symmetry, bolt hole circles, and rotational centers marked with alternating long-dash, short-dash, long-dash patterns
- **Cross-hatching for section cuts**: When a solid is cut to reveal interior structure, the exposed material surface is filled with evenly-spaced parallel diagonal lines at 45 degrees — different materials get different hatch patterns (steel vs. rubber vs. wood)
- **Orthographic projection layout**: Multiple views (top, front, side) arranged in strict alignment — features in the front view project horizontally to the side view, vertically to the top view, connected by thin construction lines
- **Title block**: Rectangular information panel in the lower-right corner containing drawing title, scale, units, date, revision number — the drawing's metadata
- **Section cut indicators**: A line with arrows at each end showing WHERE the cut was made, labeled "SECTION A-A" or "DETAIL B"
- **Revision clouds**: Irregular cloud-shaped outlines around areas that have been modified from a previous version
- **Scale indicators**: "SCALE 1:1", "SCALE 2:1" or graphical scale bars with graduated marks
- **NO color fills, NO gradients, NO shadows, NO textures** (except cross-hatching for section cuts) — geometry is defined purely by lines
- **NO artistic flourishes, NO decorative borders, NO organic shapes** — every line communicates structural information
- **NO perspective projection** — all views are orthographic (parallel projection), never converging to vanishing points

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Hierarchy/levels | Exploded assembly view — main body at center, subcomponents pulled outward along dashed center lines, numbered by assembly order | Assembly drawing showing how the whole is composed of parts |
| Flow/process | Sequential operation views labeled "STEP 1", "STEP 2", "STEP 3" — each showing the same object in a different state, arranged left to right with leader annotations describing the action | Assembly instruction sequence, each stage a separate orthographic view |
| Connections | Multiple components connected by dashed alignment lines and assembly arrows showing how parts interface — bolt patterns, mating surfaces, plug-and-socket joins | Interface drawing showing connection details between subsystems |
| Cycles | Circular callout diagram — central assembly with detail views arranged around it in a circle, leader lines pointing back to the zoomed-in areas | Detail views surrounding a general arrangement drawing |
| Comparison | Two orthographic views side by side — "BEFORE" and "AFTER" or "OPTION A" and "OPTION B" — same scale, same projection, differences highlighted in amber or red | Engineering change comparison: existing vs. proposed |
| Categories | Parts list table alongside the drawing, each part numbered with balloon callouts on the assembly, bill of materials format | Assembly drawing with associated parts list and BOM |
| Growth | Progressive assembly sequence — frame at stage 1, frame + panels at stage 2, complete system at stage 3 — each stage adds components | Build sequence showing system growing from skeleton to completion |
| Networks | System schematic showing functional blocks connected by signal/flow lines with labeled interfaces — a functional architecture rendered in engineering notation | System block diagram with interface control documents |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Energy | Flow arrows — directional arrows inside pipes or channels showing fluid/electrical/thermal flow paths with values |
| Tolerance/precision | GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing) symbols — feature control frames specifying acceptable variation |

## Typography

- Engineering sans-serif — ISOCPEUR, Simplex, or similar single-stroke drafting lettering (like Tekton or DIN 1451)
- ALL CAPITALS for dimension text, labels, notes, and title block entries — the universal engineering drawing convention
- Consistent lettering height: titles 5mm, labels 3.5mm, dimensions 2.5mm (proportionally scaled)
- Text always horizontal or aligned with dimension lines — never at arbitrary angles, never rotated for artistic effect
- Fractions displayed as stacked numerator/denominator or as decimal values — never diagonal slash
- Note text structured as numbered paragraphs: "1. ALL DIMENSIONS IN MM", "2. TOLERANCES PER ISO 2768-m"
- NO decorative fonts, NO serif faces, NO variable-weight type — everything is single-stroke engineering lettering
- NO lowercase in technical notes — mixed case only in title block fields (drawing name, project title)

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT an architectural rendering** — Architectural renderings show buildings with material textures, shadows, landscaping, and atmosphere. Technical schematics show pure geometry with dimensions. No rendered materials, no entourage, no artistic lighting.
- **NOT a circuit diagram** — While both are abstract technical drawings, circuit diagrams use specific electronic symbols (resistors, capacitors, ICs). Technical schematics use mechanical/structural symbols (dimensions, section cuts, hatching). Different visual languages.
- **NOT a subway map or flowchart** — Those are topological diagrams with colored lines and nodes. Technical schematics are geometric projections with precise dimensions and orthographic views. The intent is physical construction, not abstract relationships.
- **NOT isometric illustration** — Isometric is a pictorial view showing 3D form. Technical schematics use orthographic projection (true 2D views). No isometric axes, no 3D pictorial views (unless explicitly an auxiliary view).
- **NOT retro-futuristic or steampunk blueprint** — This is working engineering documentation, not decorative vintage aesthetic. No artificially aged paper, no ornate borders, no anachronistic mechanical fantasies. Clean, precise, functional.
- **NOT a whiteboard sketch** — Whiteboard drawings are loose, informal, variable line weight. Technical schematics are controlled, precise, uniform. Every line weight is intentional and consistent.
- **NOT an infographic with technical styling** — If you remove the blue background and white lines but the layout is still "infographic-shaped" (hero image, bullet points, decorative icons), it is just a themed infographic. True technical schematics use orthographic projection layout, dimension lines, section cuts, and parts lists.
- This must look like a professional engineer produced it as construction documentation — precise, dimensioned, annotated with leader lines, arranged in orthographic projection — not a marketing graphic that uses blue backgrounds and white lines for a "techy" feel.

## Best For

Process breakdowns and assembly sequences, system architecture and component relationships, how-it-works explanations, product anatomy and feature callouts, technical comparisons (before/after, option A/B), anything benefiting from the authority and precision of engineering documentation where every detail is measured, labeled, and purposeful.
