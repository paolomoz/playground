# pixel-art

Chunky square pixels locked to an invisible grid, every color placed one block at a time like mosaic tiles on graph paper — this is the visual language of early Nintendo, Commodore 64 loading screens, and 16-bit SNES RPG inventory menus. Limited palettes of 8-16 colors, deliberate dithering patterns where two alternating pixel colors create the illusion of a third, sprite-like objects with black pixel outlines, and that unmistakable crunch where diagonal lines become staircases of tiny squares. No anti-aliasing, no smoothing, no gradients — every pixel is a conscious decision. This is Shovel Knight, Celeste, Stardew Valley, the aesthetic of constraint turned into charm.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| NES Classic | Blue (#5C94FC) + red (#E40058) + gold (#F8B800) + white + black on midnight — 8-bit Nintendo energy |
| PICO-8 | Dark blue (#1D2B53) + dark purple (#7E2553) + dark green (#008751) + brown (#AB5236) + white + pink (#FF77A8) — the beloved fantasy console palette |
| Game Boy | Four shades of green (#0F380F, #306230, #8BAC0F, #9BBC0F) — monochrome nostalgia, maximum constraint |
| 16-Bit RPG | Rich blues + warm golds + deep reds + forest greens on black — SNES-era palette with more depth than 8-bit |
| Pastel Pixel | Soft pink (#FFA3B1) + lavender (#C2A5CF) + sky blue (#7EB8DA) + mint (#A8E6A1) — modern pixel art with softer tones |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **8-Bit** | Extreme low resolution, chunky pixels, NES/Famicom aesthetic | Very large visible pixels (16x16 or 32x32 sprite scale), maximum 4 colors per sprite, black pixel outlines, no dithering — just solid color blocks. Each element reads like a game sprite |
| **16-Bit** | Higher detail, richer palette, SNES/Genesis era | Smaller pixels allowing more detail, 16-color sprites, subtle dithering for shading, more refined forms while remaining unmistakably pixelated. RPG menu aesthetic |
| **Game Boy** | 4-shade monochrome, tiny screen, pea-soup green | Four shades of green ONLY (darkest to lightest), small viewport, dot-matrix screen texture suggestion, handheld nostalgia, maximum creative constraint |
| **Modern Pixel** | Contemporary pixel art with intentional style, larger palettes | Clean pixel placement with careful anti-aliasing choices, larger canvases, more sophisticated compositions while maintaining the grid-locked aesthetic. Celeste/Stardew Valley quality |

## Visual Elements

- **Visible square pixels** — every element built from discrete square blocks on an invisible grid. NO smooth curves, NO anti-aliasing on edges. Diagonals are staircases of single-pixel steps
- **Black pixel outlines** — sprites and objects outlined with a single-pixel-wide black border, the signature look of game sprites. Every distinct object has its own outline
- **Limited color palette** — strict color count (8, 16, or 32 colors), no color picker freedom. Colors chosen from established retro palettes (NES, PICO-8, CGA)
- **Dithering patterns** — checkerboard or regular alternating pixel patterns where two colors interleave to simulate a third color or create gradient-like transitions
- **Sprite-like objects** — every icon, figure, and element rendered as if it were a game sprite: square, outlined, facing forward, readable at small sizes
- **Tile-based backgrounds** — repeating 8x8 or 16x16 pixel tile patterns for backgrounds and borders, like game tileset textures (brick, grass, water)
- **UI frame borders** — decorative pixel borders around content areas resembling RPG dialog boxes: double-line borders with rounded pixel corners, often blue or dark with light interior
- **Health-bar and stat-display formatting** — progress bars, numbered stats, inventory grid layouts borrowed from game UI conventions
- **Pixel-perfect symmetry** — sprites and icons are bilaterally symmetric, each pixel deliberately placed, no randomness or organic irregularity
- **Animation frame suggestion** — objects can show slight frame variations (idle animation) with 2-3 pixel differences suggesting movement
- **Staircase diagonals** — any line that is not perfectly horizontal or vertical becomes a visible staircase of pixel steps, and this is EMBRACED not hidden
- **Shadow pixels** — a single row of darker pixels below objects for grounding, or a darker outline on the bottom-right edges for pseudo-3D
- **NO smooth gradients** — transitions between values happen through dithering (checkerboard interleaving) or hard color steps, never smooth blends
- **NO anti-aliasing** — edges are crisp, jagged pixel steps. The crunch IS the aesthetic

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical tower of stacked pixel platforms, largest at base, items placed on each level like game platforms | Side-scrolling platformer level design with platforms at different heights |
| Flow/process | Left-to-right pixel path with sprite-like icons at each stop, arrow tiles pointing the direction | Overworld map from a top-down RPG, path connecting locations |
| Connections | Pixel lines (1-2px wide) connecting sprite nodes, resembling a game map or circuit board | Zelda dungeon map with rooms connected by corridors |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of sprites with pixel arrow tiles showing rotation direction | RPG elemental weakness wheel — fire beats ice beats lightning |
| Comparison | Split screen — two tile-based panels side by side with different sprite contents | Character select screen, A vs B comparison |
| Categories | Grid of equal-sized cells, each containing a sprite icon — the inventory screen layout | RPG inventory grid, item shop display, bestiary |
| Growth | Progress bar filling left-to-right in pixel blocks, or sprite evolving through size stages | Experience bar, Pokemon evolution sequence |
| Stats | Stat bars, numeric values, and icon labels arranged in RPG character-sheet format | RPG status screen with HP/MP bars and stat numbers |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Pixel Art Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Pixel sprites proportionally sized — larger sprite = more data, or filled vs. empty progress bars |
| Processes | Overworld map path connecting location sprites, numbered stops, arrow tiles showing direction |
| Systems | Circuit-board pixel layout with connected nodes, or dungeon map with linked rooms |
| Connections | Single-pixel lines linking sprite icons, or adjacent tiles sharing borders |
| Growth | Progress bar filling with pixel blocks, or sprite evolution sequence (small → medium → large) |
| Time | Left-to-right timeline with day/night pixel sky gradient (dithered), or clock sprite animation frames |
| Hierarchy | Platform levels — higher platform = higher rank, largest sprite = most important |
| Protection | Shield sprite icon, pixel border frame enclosing content, castle wall tiles |
| Speed | Motion-blur pixel trail (duplicate sprite fading to right), arrow tile pointing right |
| Stability | Large square block sprite anchored at base, brick tile foundation |
| Users/people | Character sprites — 16x16 or 32x32 figures with 2-3 animation frames, RPG party lineup |
| Ideas | Lightbulb sprite, exclamation-mark bubble (!) above character head, sparkle pixel effect |
| Energy | Lightning bolt sprite, fire animation tiles, power-up item with sparkle pixels |
| Completion | Checkmark sprite in a box, trophy pixel icon, "QUEST COMPLETE" banner |

## Typography

- Pixel fonts exclusively — every letter built from visible square pixels on the grid, monospaced or proportional but always pixel-constructed
- ALL CAPS for headlines and labels — easier to render legibly at low pixel resolutions
- 8x8 or 6x8 pixel character cells for body text — the standard game font sizes
- White text on dark UI panels, or black text on light scroll/sign sprites
- Text contained in RPG-style dialog boxes with decorative pixel borders
- Numbers rendered in pixel font, often with leading zeros (003, 012) echoing game score displays
- NO smooth fonts, NO anti-aliased text, NO vector type — every letterform is a pixel grid construction
- Emphasis through color change (white → yellow for highlighted text) or SIZE (2x pixel scale for headers)
- Text can include game-style punctuation and symbols: arrows (→), hearts, stars, all in pixel form

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT smooth or anti-aliased** — If any edge is smooth, any curve is clean, any gradient is continuous, it is NOT pixel art. The visible grid and staircase edges are FUNDAMENTAL. Anti-aliasing is the enemy.
- **NOT high-resolution illustration in a pixel frame** — The content itself must BE pixels, not a smooth illustration with a pixel border. Every element, every icon, every letter is built from discrete squares.
- **NOT voxel or isometric 3D** — While **isometric-technical** and **axonometric** share grid-based aesthetics, pixel art is FLAT 2D sprite-based, not 3D block construction. No voxel cubes, no isometric perspective.
- **NOT retro-themed modern design** — A clean modern layout with a pixel font slapped on it is NOT pixel art. The entire visual system must operate within pixel constraints.
- **NOT blurry or upscaled poorly** — Pixel art must be scaled using nearest-neighbor interpolation ONLY, never bilinear or bicubic. Blurry pixels are a crime against the aesthetic.
- **NOT unlimited palette** — Strict color limits are not optional. If you are using 50+ colors with free gradients, you have abandoned the core constraint. Limit to 8-32 colors from a defined palette.
- **NOT keith-haring or pop-art-lichtenstein** — Those styles use bold outlines but SMOOTH curves and organic shapes. Pixel art uses outlines too but every line is grid-locked and staircase-stepped.
- **NOT bauhaus** — Bauhaus uses perfect geometric primitives (true circles, straight diagonals). Pixel art approximates these forms with jagged pixel grids — the imperfection IS the character.
- This must look like a screenshot from an NES, SNES, or Game Boy game — sprites on a tile grid, limited palette, dithered shading, pixel fonts, RPG UI frames — not a modern illustration that happens to be low-resolution.
