Thick black outlines dancing across every surface — radiant babies crawling and glowing with life-force energy lines, barking dogs with parallel strokes shooting from open snouts, faceless figures with arms thrust skyward in universal celebration. This is subway chalk on black paper, the Pop Shop's democratic merchandise, the Crack is Wack mural's urgent public message — where confident unbroken marker strokes transform flat surfaces into kinetic fields of human connection. Every figure outlined in unwavering thick black, filled with solid flat primary color or left empty, radiating short parallel motion lines that pulse with unstoppable life. Joyful, urgent, immediate, accessible — street art distilled into universal pictographic language.

## Color Palette

- Primary: Jet black (#000000) for ALL outlines — the single non-negotiable defining element, thick confident unbroken strokes of absolute black
- Fills: Signal red (#FF0000), sunshine yellow (#FFFF00), electric green (#00FF00), hot pink (#FF69B4), true blue (#0000FF), pure orange (#FF8C00)
- Background: Pure white (#FFFFFF), solid black (#000000), or a single flat saturated color field (red, yellow, or blue)
- Radiant/motion lines: Always black on light grounds; white or same-color on dark grounds
- Text: Black outlines only, or white reversed out of black — NEVER colored text, NEVER thin text

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Subway Chalk | White figures drawn on solid black background — the original NYC public art aesthetic, chalk on the empty advertising panels of the underground, raw and immediate |
| Primary Energy | Red + yellow + blue solid fills with black outlines on white ground — maximum pop, maximum readability, the Pop Shop poster palette |
| Neon Night | Hot pink + electric green + orange with thick black outlines on white — nightclub flyer energy, 1980s downtown Manhattan |
| Monochrome Icon | Single color (signal red or sunshine yellow) + black outlines + white background — focused iconic power, logo-like brand impact |
| Full Spectrum | Red + yellow + green + blue + pink + orange, every figure a different color, all outlined in black on white — the complete democratic rainbow of human energy |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Radiant** | Figures with short parallel energy/motion lines radiating outward from edges — the "radiant baby" glow that makes everything vibrate with life | 3-5 short parallel black lines shooting outward from figure shoulders, heads, hands, feet — radiating in bursts at key energy points. The MORE lines, the MORE energy. Without these lines, it's just a silhouette, not Haring |
| **Crowd** | Densely packed interlocking figures filling every square inch, a tapestry of human forms | Bodies filling the entire frame edge to edge, arms and legs overlapping and interlocking like puzzle pieces, each figure a different solid color, all outlined in identical thick black. Horror vacui of human connection |
| **Icon** | Single bold figure centered with maximum negative space, monumental logo-like simplicity | One barking dog, one radiant baby, one dancing figure — isolated on white or solid color ground, enormous and immediate, iconic enough to be a trademark |
| **Mural** | Sprawling narrative composition with figures interacting across the full canvas | Figures crawling over, dancing with, supporting, and connecting to each other in continuous visual narrative spanning the entire frame, no panel divisions, one flowing scene |

## Visual Elements

- **Thick black outlines on EVERYTHING** — the absolute non-negotiable core of the style. 6-10px confident unbroken strokes of pure black around every figure, every shape, every element. Consistent weight throughout, no tapering, no variation. If it doesn't have thick uniform black outlines, it is NOT Keith Haring
- **Radiant/motion lines** — short parallel lines (3-5 per burst) radiating outward from figure edges, heads, hands, and feet, indicating energy, movement, importance, and life force. This is THE second defining element after outlines. Every significant figure needs radiant lines
- **Faceless human figures** — humans rendered without ANY facial features whatsoever: no eyes, no nose, no mouth, no expression. Just a smooth rounded head shape. All identity conveyed through body pose and gesture alone
- **Arms raised in celebration** — figures with both arms thrust straight up in the air: the universal gesture of joy, unity, victory, engagement. The most common Haring pose
- **Crawling radiant babies** — the iconic figure: infant on hands and knees, entire body radiating parallel energy lines from every edge, symbol of innocence, life force, and emerging power
- **Barking dogs** — simplified dog form in profile with wide-open mouth, 3-5 short parallel lines shooting forward from the snout indicating bark/sound/communication, often shown alongside human figures
- **Dancing figures** — bodies captured in dynamic mid-motion: legs wide apart, arms swinging at different angles, torso twisted, frozen at the peak of movement energy
- **Pyramids of stacked figures** — humans standing on each other's shoulders in geometric human towers, or arranged in triangular formations, community as architecture
- **Interlocking bodies** — figures whose limbs connect, wrap around, or flow into adjacent figures, making human connection physically literal and visible
- **Heart shapes** — simple outlined hearts, often held aloft by figures or radiating from the chest area, love and compassion as graphic symbol
- **Solid flat color fills** — each figure filled with ONE solid saturated color: flat red, flat yellow, flat green, flat blue. NO gradients, NO shading, NO tonal variation within a fill. Different figures get different solid colors
- **X marks** — bold X symbols on figure torsos, or standalone X shapes as compositional elements indicating negation, marking, or emphasis
- **NO interior detail on figures** — no clothing lines, no muscle definition, no anatomical features, no patterns within the silhouette. Pure flat fill inside, thick black outline outside
- **NO background patterns or textures** — backgrounds are flat solid white, flat solid black, or flat solid single color. Nothing else

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Large central figure with maximum radiant lines at center or top, progressively smaller figures around/below with fewer radiant lines, size and energy-line density = importance | Radiant baby as focal sun, crowd of smaller responding figures orbiting |
| Flow/process | Figures moving left-to-right in clear sequence, each figure in a distinct stage of action, the flow of motion carrying the eye across the composition like a sentence | Line of dancing figures, each in the next beat of the movement, a visual conga of sequential steps |
| Connections | Figures with physically interlocking arms, holding hands across space, limbs wrapping around adjacent bodies, or stacked in supporting pyramids | Chain of humans, each gripping the next, or pyramid of figures standing on shoulders |
| Cycles | Figures arranged in a circle all facing/moving in the same rotational direction, or radiant figure at center with satellite figures orbiting in a ring | Ring of identical dancing figures, or radiant baby as sun with orbiting human planets |
| Comparison | Two figures facing each other in contrasting poses — one arms up, one arms down; one filled red, one filled blue — using gesture and color to show difference without conflict | Mirror figures: same outline, opposite energy, contrasting solid fills |
| Categories | Each category represented by a different Haring figure archetype: baby for one, dog for another, dancer for a third, each in their own distinct solid color | Haring's icon vocabulary deployed as categorical symbols |
| Energy/importance | Number of radiant lines surrounding a figure directly indicates its energy level — sparse lines = calm, dense burst of lines = maximum intensity | More radiant lines = more visual volume, like turning up the speaker |
| Unity/community | All figures rendered identically in the same pose (arms raised), differentiated ONLY by their fill color — collective identity expressed through uniform gesture | Crowd of identical figures, same pose, rainbow of individual colors, unified action |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Keith Haring Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Data/information | Density of radiant lines — more parallel lines radiating from a figure = more importance, more energy, more information weight |
| Processes | Chain of dancing figures in sequential poses, each showing the next stage of action, left-to-right temporal flow |
| Systems | Interlocking figures supporting each other: limbs connecting, bodies stacked, a human machine of interdependent parts |
| Connections | Figures physically holding hands, or a barking dog (communication) positioned between two humans bridging them |
| Growth | Crawling radiant baby — the universal Haring symbol of innocence, new life, emerging power, and unstoppable emerging energy |
| Time | Left-to-right sequence of figures in progressive poses, earlier poses simpler, later poses more energetic |
| Hierarchy | Figure size and radiant line density: largest figure with most dense radiant lines at compositional apex, smaller dimmer figures below |
| Protection | Larger figure with arms forming a protective arch or enclosure over smaller figures sheltered underneath |
| Speed | Running figure in mid-stride with extra radiant/motion lines streaming behind like a wake, body leaning forward into motion |
| Stability | Figure planted solidly with legs apart, arms at sides or hands on hips, grounded firmly on the baseline |
| Users/people | Faceless human figures — identity expressed entirely through body action and gesture, never through facial features |
| Ideas | Radiant head — figure with dense burst of parallel lines radiating specifically from the skull area, thought as visible energy |
| Energy | Maximum radiant lines everywhere, both arms raised, body in peak dynamic pose, the figure practically vibrating off the surface |
| Community | Dense crowd of interlocking figures, pyramid of stacked humans, or circle of dancers — many bodies as one |
| Communication | Barking dog projecting parallel lines from mouth (broadcasting), or two figures with radiant lines directed toward each other |
| Love | Figure holding a large outlined heart shape above its head, or heart radiating from chest area with its own energy lines |

## Typography

- Bold heavy sans-serif with thick strokes matching the figure outline weight — type must feel as bold as the figures
- ALL CAPS strongly preferred — matches the bold graphic urgency and street-art energy
- Individual letters can be outlined in thick black and filled with solid flat color, treated exactly like the figures
- Text integrated as graphic shape within the composition, not floating separately — words occupy the same visual plane as figures
- Words can curve, stack, arc, or arrange dynamically — not locked into rigid horizontal baselines
- Black text on white, or white text reversed out of black — the only two options
- Type should feel hand-painted with a broad brush or fat marker: confident, urgent, immediate — like protest sign lettering or subway graffiti
- NEVER thin, NEVER elegant, NEVER decorative, NEVER serif — always bold, always immediate, always shouting
- Letter-spacing can be tight (words as solid blocks) or wide (letters as individual graphic elements)

## Anti-Patterns

- **NOT detailed or realistic** — Haring figures have ZERO interior detail. No faces, no clothing patterns, no muscle definition, no anatomical accuracy. Pure simplified silhouette with flat fill and thick outline. If you can identify what the figure is wearing, you have gone too far.
- **NOT thin lines** — the thick black outline is THE ENTIRE AESTHETIC. Thin, delicate, varied-weight, or tapered lines completely destroy the style. Default to BOLDER than you think necessary. 6-10px minimum.
- **NOT gradient or shaded** — all fills are 100% solid flat saturated color. No blending, no tonal gradation, no dimensional shading, no color transitions anywhere in the entire composition. Flat. Solid. Period.
- **NOT realistic or anatomical** — figures are abstracted to their most elemental symbolic form. If it looks anatomically proportioned or realistically posed, it has completely missed the point.
- **NOT static or frozen** — figures should radiate motion, energy, and life even when standing still (that is what the radiant lines are FOR). Static planted poses without energy lines produce dead silhouettes, not Haring.
- **NOT isolated without radiant lines** — even a single figure needs those short parallel radiating lines. Without energy/motion lines shooting from the edges, it is merely a silhouette, not a Keith Haring figure. The lines are mandatory.
- **NOT Basquiat** — Basquiat is raw, scratchy, text-heavy, layered with written words, crown motifs, anatomical drawings, and collaged elements. Haring is clean unified outlines, smooth flat fills, radiant energy, pure form.
- **NOT Banksy** — Banksy is stencil-based, politically specific, photographically detailed, monochrome with selective color. Haring is continuous freehand outlines, universal symbols, fully colored, pure graphic energy.
- **NOT Memphis design** — Memphis is pattern-on-pattern chaos, zigzags, terrazzo confetti, deliberate clashing. Haring is clean solid flat fills with thick outlines, NO patterns, NO textures, NO surface decoration within figures.
- **NOT pop art (Lichtenstein/Warhol)** — pop art uses halftone dot patterns, photographic source material, commercial imagery, and repetition grids. Haring uses original hand-drawn figures, solid fills, and radiant energy lines. No Ben-Day dots.
- This must look like it was drawn with a thick black marker on a subway wall, a Pop Shop poster, or the side of a building in the Lower East Side circa 1984 — thick confident outlines, flat solid fills, faceless figures radiating energy, the democracy of line.
