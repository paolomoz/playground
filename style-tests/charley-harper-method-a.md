Mid-century American nature illustration reduced to its purest geometric essence: every bird, leaf, and animal is distilled into interlocking flat shapes — circles, triangles, ellipses, and crescents — with no unnecessary detail, no shading, and no outline heavier than another. Bold saturated colors sit side by side without gradients, creating compositions where a single cardinal is three red triangles and a black circle, and a flock of birds is a rhythmic pattern of repeating chevrons against a flat sky. This is "minimal realism" — identify the subject's single most recognizable feature and build the entire image from that insight.

## Variants
| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| Single Subject | One animal or bird filling 70%+ of the canvas, reduced to 5-8 geometric shapes, minimal background | Maximum geometric abstraction, bold color blocking, creature's silhouette IS the composition |
| Habitat Scene | Animal in its environment — tree, water, foliage rendered as flat overlapping shapes | Layered flat color planes creating depth without perspective, subject integrated into pattern of environment |
| Pattern Flock | Multiple identical or similar creatures arranged in a rhythmic repeating pattern across the field | Repetition, tessellation, positive/negative space interplay, the group IS the pattern |
| Seasonal Landscape | Trees, plants, weather rendered as pure geometry to convey a season or ecosystem | Color palette carries the season; shapes are botanical but radically simplified; no single animal focal point |

## Visual Elements
- **Animals reduced to 4-8 geometric primitives**: A bird is a circle (head) + triangle (beak) + ellipse (body) + triangles (tail feathers). A fox is a large triangle (body) + smaller triangle (ears) + circle (nose). NO anatomical detail, NO feather texture, NO fur rendering — just pure interlocking shapes
- **Single dot eyes**: Every creature has a single small solid circle for an eye (black or dark color), perfectly round, placed precisely to give the animal its characteristic gaze — this single dot carries all the personality and expression
- **Flat color fills with ZERO gradients**: Each geometric shape is filled with a single solid color. No gradients, no shading, no highlights, no soft edges. Color meets color at a hard clean edge
- **Clever negative space forming hidden shapes**: The background color visible between and around the geometric shapes creates secondary forms — a gap between two birds becomes a leaf shape, the space inside a curled tail becomes an egg. Background is not "empty" — it is an active design element
- **Overlapping flat planes for depth**: Foreground shapes overlap background shapes with no shadow or transparency — a green leaf triangle sits atop a brown branch rectangle sits atop a cream sky. Depth is communicated purely by which shape is in front
- **Botanical elements as pure geometry**: Leaves are simple pointed ellipses or triangles. Tree trunks are tall rectangles or tapered trapezoids. Branches are thin angled lines. Flowers are circles with radiating petal shapes (teardrops or semicircles). Berries are small solid circles in a cluster
- **Rhythmic repetition of identical shapes**: A row of birds on a wire is the same chevron shape repeated 8 times with slight size variation. A school of fish is the same elongated diamond repeated in staggered rows. Repetition IS the visual texture
- **Large areas of flat unbroken background color**: At least 30-40% of the canvas is a single unbroken background color (cream, pale blue, sage green). This breathing room is essential — the empty space makes the geometric subjects powerful
- **Subtle asymmetric compositions**: The main subject is placed off-center (rule-of-thirds positioning), often looking or pointing toward the larger open space. The composition feels balanced but NOT symmetrical
- **Clean hard edges everywhere**: Every shape boundary is a crisp, clean, hard edge. No feathering, no anti-aliasing blur, no soft transitions. Shapes snap together like puzzle pieces
- **Warm mid-century color temperature**: Colors are slightly warm and muted compared to pure primaries — not fire-engine red but cardinal red, not royal blue but cerulean, not lime green but leaf green. The palette feels like 1960s screen-printed posters
- **Integrated typography as design element**: When text appears, it is set in a clean mid-century sans-serif and treated as another geometric element in the composition — positioned to work with the shapes, not slapped on top
- **Scale play for emphasis**: The most important subject is dramatically larger than supporting elements. A single bird may be 10x the size of the tree it perches on. Accurate relative scale is deliberately abandoned for compositional impact

## Compositional Patterns
| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy / Rankings | A single large geometric animal at top with progressively smaller geometric creatures below, each simpler than the one above, on flat cream background | Size = importance, arranged vertically like a totem |
| Process / Timeline | Horizontal sequence of 3-5 panels, each containing one geometric scene (seed → sprout → tree → fruit → pie), connected by a simple flat-color ground line | Seasonal progression strip, left-to-right reading |
| Comparison | Two geometric animals facing each other from opposite sides of the canvas, mirror-composed, each in its own color zone, shared background color between them | Cardinal vs Blue Jay — same shapes, different palette |
| Parts of a Whole | One large geometric animal at center with callout lines pointing to smaller isolated shapes around the perimeter, each labeled with a mid-century sans-serif label | Anatomy of a bird — beak triangle, wing ellipse, tail chevron |
| Geographic / Spatial | Flat color landscape divided into horizontal bands (sky, hills, water, ground) with small geometric animals and plants placed as pattern elements within each band | Habitat layers — each band is an ecosystem zone |
| Categories / Groups | Grid of equal rectangles, each containing one centered geometric animal on a distinct background color, with a small label below — sorted by color family or type | Field guide identification plate |
| Cause and Effect | Left: geometric scene A (caterpillar on leaf). Right: geometric scene B (butterfly above flower). A single curved arrow shape in a contrasting color connects them | Metamorphosis diagram |
| Flow / Cycle | Circular arrangement of 4-6 geometric season/stage illustrations arranged clockwise around a central circular element, connected by curved flat-color arcs | Annual migration cycle or life cycle |
| Data Quantities | Rows of identical small geometric animal silhouettes (each a 3-shape bird) repeated to represent count, different species/colors for categories | Pictorial statistics using birds as counting units |
| Overview + Detail | Large habitat scene occupying 70% of canvas with 3 small detail callout boxes at right edge, each zooming into one geometric element from the scene | Ecosystem overview with species spotlights |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings
| Abstract Concept | Charley Harper Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Growth | A single tree shown in three stages — bare trunk rectangle, small green triangle crown, large lush green circle crown — progressing left to right on cream background |
| Speed / Velocity | A geometric bird (swift or falcon) rendered as an extreme horizontal elongated triangle with tiny head dot, implying aerodynamic speed through shape alone, no motion lines |
| Connection | A vine rendered as a single curving green line connecting two geometric elements (bird to nest, flower to bee), the line itself forming a beautiful arabesque shape |
| Danger / Risk | A geometric snake (zigzag triangle pattern body, diamond head, dot eye) coiled in a compact spiral shape, red and charcoal triangles interlocking |
| Discovery | A geometric owl with enormous circular eyes (two large concentric circles) peering out from a simple rectangular tree hollow against a dark background |
| Money / Cost | A geometric squirrel hoarding acorns — circle body, triangle ear tufts, surrounded by a cluster of small brown circles (acorns) it is gathering |
| Time | A tree shown with four quadrants of foliage in four seasonal colors (green, orange, bare brown, pink blossom) — one geometric tree containing all four seasons |
| Security / Protection | A geometric turtle — dome semicircle shell with hexagonal pattern, tiny triangle head and dot eye peeking out, solid and impenetrable |
| Communication | Two geometric songbirds facing each other on a branch line, beaks open (triangles pointing at each other), small geometric note shapes between them |
| Global / International | A geometric globe rendered as a circle divided into flat continental shapes in different greens and blues, with a single migratory bird (chevron) arcing over it |
| Complexity | A dense flock of many overlapping geometric birds creating an intricate tessellated pattern where individual shapes merge into a complex unified whole |
| Failure / Error | A geometric egg (simple oval) shown cracked into two pieces with a zigzag line between them, against a flat nest shape (brown crescent), on cream background |
| Innovation | A geometric hummingbird (tiny body, long needle beak triangle, blur-circle wings) hovering beside a geometric flower — the only Harper creature that defies gravity |
| Balance | Two geometric birds of equal size perched on opposite ends of a horizontal branch line, the branch perfectly level, symmetric weight distribution |
| Collaboration | A geometric beehive (hexagonal cross-section) with multiple identical small geometric bees (oval + triangle wings) working around it in an organized pattern |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Clean mid-century geometric sans-serif — Futura, Century Gothic, Avenir, or Neutra Text; letterforms must be round, geometric, and warm, echoing the circular and triangular shapes in the illustrations
- **Title Treatment**: Lowercase or mixed case in medium weight, generously tracked, placed as an integrated compositional element — NOT floating above the illustration but positioned to work WITH the geometric shapes; 24-36pt equivalent; color matched to one of the illustration's palette colors
- **Body Labels**: Lowercase, regular weight, 10-14pt equivalent, in charcoal `#3A3A3A` or matched accent color; placed in open background areas with generous surrounding space — NEVER overlapping illustration elements
- **Number Callouts**: Light-weight numerals in a matching sans-serif, placed inside or beside simple geometric shapes (circles, squares) that match the illustration's vocabulary
- **NO decorative, script, or heavy display typefaces**: Typography must be as clean and geometric as the illustrations — no ornament, no serifs, no hand-lettered looks
- **NO outlined or shadowed text**: Text is flat single-color fills, same as every other element. No outlines, no drop shadows, no gradients on letterforms
- **NO text heavier than the illustration**: Type should feel lighter and quieter than the geometric shapes — it supports, never dominates

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO realistic animal illustration**: Do NOT draw anatomically correct animals with fur texture, feather detail, whisker lines, or muscle definition. Harper animals are 4-8 flat geometric shapes. **If you can count more than 10 shapes in one animal, it is TOO detailed**
- **NO gradients, shading, or highlights on any shape**: Every shape is a single flat color. NO soft shading to suggest volume, NO highlights on beaks, NO shadow under wings. **ZERO gradients anywhere. Flat. Flat. Flat.**
- **NO outlines or strokes around shapes**: Shapes are defined by their flat color meeting the background or adjacent shape color at a hard edge. Do NOT add black outlines, dark strokes, or borders around the geometric forms. **Harper shapes have NO outlines — color boundaries ARE the edges**
- **NO scattered floating decorative elements**: Every shape in the composition has a purpose — it is part of an animal, plant, or environmental element. Do NOT scatter random circles, stars, confetti, or abstract decorations. **NO floating ornaments, NO sprinkled dots, NO confetti**
- **NO complex detailed backgrounds**: Backgrounds are flat single-color fields or at most 2-3 flat horizontal color bands (sky + ground). Do NOT add detailed landscapes, textured skies, busy patterns, or photographic backgrounds. **Background simplicity is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- **NO photorealistic or 3D rendering**: This is flat 2D geometric illustration. NO 3D modeling, NO ray tracing, NO photographic textures, NO lens effects, NO depth of field. **Flat shapes on flat background, period**
- **NO manga, anime, cartoon, or Disney style**: Do NOT give animals large expressive eyes, exaggerated expressions, anthropomorphic poses, or cute kawaii features. Harper animals have ONE DOT EYE and geometric bodies. **No expression, no personality from face — personality comes from SHAPE and POSE**
- **NO busy crowded compositions**: At least 30% of the canvas must be open background color. Do NOT fill every corner with shapes. The breathing room and negative space are as important as the shapes. **If the composition feels crowded, remove elements**
- **NO symmetrical centered compositions**: Do NOT place the main subject dead center facing forward. Harper compositions are asymmetric — subject off-center, looking into open space. **Center-weighted compositions feel static and un-Harper**
- **NO textured or distressed surfaces**: No paper texture, no grain, no halftone dots, no screen-print misregistration, no ink splatter. Surfaces are perfectly smooth flat digital color. **Clean, crisp, untextured**
- **NO dark moody color palettes**: Harper's palette is warm, saturated, and cheerful even in winter scenes. Do NOT use dark gothic colors, neon colors, or desaturated gray palettes. **Colors are bold and warm, NEVER gloomy**
- **NO perspective or vanishing points**: This is flat graphic design, not architectural rendering. No converging lines, no foreshortening, no three-point perspective. Objects exist on a flat picture plane. **Flat flat flat — no spatial recession**
- **NO thin spindly line work or detailed pen illustration**: This is NOT a pen-and-ink drawing. There are NO thin lines depicting texture, NO crosshatching, NO stippling. If a shape is too thin to fill with color, it should not exist. **Every element is a SHAPE, not a LINE**
