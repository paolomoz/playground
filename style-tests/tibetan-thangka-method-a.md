# tibetan-thangka

Sacred Buddhist scroll painting on primed cotton canvas, rendered in opaque mineral pigments and liquid gold, depicting deities, mandalas, and cosmological diagrams within rigid symmetrical compositions framed by rainbow-banded borders. Every element is outlined in fine ink and filled with saturated jewel-tone pigments — lapis ultramarine, malachite green, cinnabar red, orpiment gold — producing infographics that read like devotional paintings from a Tibetan monastery: radiant, hieratic, and meticulously ordered.

## Visual Elements
- **Central deity figure on lotus pedestal**: A principal illustrated figure seated or standing on a stylized open lotus flower with individually outlined petals in pink and green, each petal edged in fine gold line, the figure in perfect frontal or three-quarter pose
- **Flame aureole (mandorla) surrounding key elements**: An almond-shaped halo of stylized flames in graduated bands — innermost gold, then orange, then red, then deep blue — enclosing the central subject, with each flame tongue individually drawn as a curving pointed shape
- **Concentric mandala rings**: Perfect geometric circles nested within squares nested within circles, each ring filled with a different jewel-tone color, forming a radiant target-like composition that draws the eye inward to the center
- **Rainbow-banded border frame**: The entire composition enclosed by a rectangular border made of thin parallel stripes in the spectral order — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet — each stripe a flat solid color band approximately 3-4px wide
- **Stylized lotus flowers as containers**: Open lotus blossoms viewed from above used as frames for content — eight or sixteen symmetrical petals radiating from a circular center, each petal a flat pink, white, or blue filled with gold outline
- **Cloud scrolls as connectors**: Stylized Chinese-Tibetan cloud formations — rounded, billowing, multi-lobed shapes outlined in gold on blue or white — used to float elements and connect sections, clouds always curling in tight symmetrical spirals
- **Seven jewel offerings as icons**: Specific symbolic objects — wheel, jewel, queen, minister, elephant, horse, general — each drawn as a small flat-color icon with gold outline, usable as category markers or bullet points
- **Gold filigree vine patterns filling negative space**: Thin gold line scrollwork of repeating vine and leaf motifs filling background areas, creating a rich textile-like ground rather than empty space, always symmetrical and evenly distributed
- **Vajra (thunderbolt scepter) as dividers**: The double-ended ritual implement drawn horizontally as a section separator — a central sphere flanked by symmetrical prongs, rendered in gold with blue or white accents
- **Dharma wheel as central hub**: An eight-spoked wheel with a round hub and pointed rim, drawn in burnished gold with each spoke clearly visible, used as a central organizing element for radial compositions
- **Wish-fulfilling jewel (cintamani) as bullet markers**: A flaming triple-gem motif — three round jewels stacked in a triangle, topped by a small flame, outlined in gold — used to mark list items or data points
- **Offering bowls in rows**: Seven small identical bowl shapes filled with different offerings (water, flowers, incense, light, perfume, food, music), drawn as a repeated icon row for sequential or categorical data
- **Throne-back architectural frames**: Ornate carved wooden throne backs — with columns, arches, and crowning makara (sea-creature) finials — used as frames around important content panels
- **Prayer flag string as header banners**: Rectangular flags in five colors (blue, white, red, green, yellow) strung on a horizontal cord, each flag containing a text label, used as navigation or category headers

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Elegant serif with slight calligraphic modulation — Cormorant Garamond, Playfair Display, or EB Garamond; letterforms should echo the refined pen-drawn quality of Tibetan manuscript headers
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS or Title Case with generous letter-spacing, rendered in burnished gold color on a deep blue or maroon banner ribbon with rainbow-striped edges; 28-36pt equivalent
- **Body Labels**: Sentence case, regular weight, 12-16pt equivalent, always inside a lotus-petal frame, rectangular gold-bordered panel, or cloud-scroll container — NEVER floating freely in open space
- **Number Callouts**: Bold numerals inside small dharma-wheel or lotus-circle frames in burnished gold, 10-14pt
- **Sanskrit/Decorative Headers**: Optionally use Uchen-style Tibetan letterform ornaments as purely decorative headers — symmetrical, calligraphic, functioning as visual dividers rather than readable text
- **NO modern sans-serif typefaces**: This style demands serif or calligraphic letter forms to match the hand-painted manuscript tradition
- **NO text with drop shadows or 3D extrusion effects**: Text is flat gold on dark ground or flat dark on gold/light ground, always within a containing frame

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO photorealistic rendering — NOT photographs, NOT 3D renders, NOT AI photo-style**: This is opaque mineral-pigment painting. Flat saturated color fills, fine ink outlines, gold accents. If it looks like a photograph, it is wrong. **Repeat: NO PHOTOREALISM**
- **NO loose brushwork, NO visible brushstrokes, NO impressionistic effects**: Thangka painting is precise and controlled. Every edge is a clean fine line. There is NO gestural spontaneity, NO dripping, NO splatter. **This is NOT expressionist painting**
- **NO Western perspective with vanishing points**: Thangka uses hierarchical scale (important = larger) and stacked spatial planes (far = higher on canvas), NOT Renaissance linear perspective. **NO converging orthogonals, NO foreshortening**
- **NO dark moody lighting, NO dramatic chiaroscuro, NO cast shadows**: The world of thangka is evenly illuminated by spiritual radiance. Everything is bright, saturated, and visible. **ZERO shadows of any kind. NO dark shadow sides on objects**
- **NO empty negative space left unfilled**: Traditional thangka fills the entire canvas. Background areas get gold filigree scrollwork, cloud patterns, or jewel-tone color fields. **NO large areas of flat single-color emptiness**
- **NO cartoon or comic-book style**: Do NOT simplify to Western cartoon proportions, thick outlines, or comic-book coloring. Thangka figures are elegant, elongated, and precisely proportioned according to iconometric canon. **NO chibi, NO manga eyes, NO superhero anatomy**
- **NO scattered random objects floating in space**: Every element has a ritual or compositional purpose. Objects sit on lotus seats, altars, offering tables, or cloud scrolls. They do NOT float randomly. **NO confetti, NO sprinkled decorations, NO random floating icons**
- **NO neon colors, NO fluorescent hues, NO electric blue or hot pink**: The palette is mineral pigments — lapis, cinnabar, malachite, orpiment. Colors are deep, rich, and slightly earthy. **NO candy colors, NO synthetic hues**
- **NO asymmetrical compositions without purpose**: Thangka is fundamentally symmetrical. The left and right sides should mirror each other unless depicting a specific narrative scene. **Default to bilateral symmetry**
- **NO Western religious iconography mixed in**: Do NOT add crosses, halos (round disc type), angels, or church architecture. This is Buddhist visual language exclusively. **NO Christian, Islamic, or Hindu imagery**
- **NO rough textures, NO paper grain, NO canvas weave showing**: The painting surface reads as smooth, opaque, and pristine. Texture comes from the painted details, not the ground. **NO distressed or aged effects unless specifically requested**
- **NO gradients in flame aureoles or background**: Each band of the mandorla flame is a FLAT color. The background is a FLAT deep blue or gold. Color transitions happen as discrete adjacent bands, NOT as smooth gradients. **Bands, NOT blends**
