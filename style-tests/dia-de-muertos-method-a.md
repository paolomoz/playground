# dia-de-muertos

Exuberant Mexican folk art celebrating the Day of the Dead — decorated sugar skulls (calaveras de azucar) with intricate icing scrollwork, explosions of cempasuchil marigolds, papel picado tissue-paper banners punched with skeleton motifs, all rendered in saturated pigments on deep black grounds. Every surface is ornamented with spiraling vines, crossbones, hearts, and flowers in the vibrant palette of a Oaxacan altar: blazing marigold orange, magenta pink, violet purple, and skeletal white, producing infographics that read like a folk-art ofrenda come to life — joyful, ornate, and unapologetically maximal.

## Visual Elements
- **Decorated sugar skulls (calaveras de azucar)**: Stylized human skulls viewed from the front, eye sockets filled with concentric flower or heart shapes in magenta and turquoise, foreheads bearing a cross or flower, chin and cheeks covered with symmetrical icing scrollwork in white on colored ground, teeth shown as a neat grid of small white squares
- **Cempasuchil marigold flowers**: Densely petaled round marigold blossoms in blazing orange and golden yellow, each petal individually outlined, flowers clustered in garlands, arches, or scattered as filler — always with visible layered petal texture, never simplified to a basic circle
- **Papel picado banners**: Rectangular tissue-paper sheets with intricate punched-out patterns (skulls, flowers, doves, crosses, spiderwebs) hung on a horizontal string, alternating in vibrant colors (pink, purple, orange, green, yellow), edges showing the characteristic scalloped or zig-zag cut border
- **Catrina skeleton figures**: Full-body elegant skeleton figures (inspired by Posada's La Catrina) wearing large feathered hats, ruffled dresses, suits, or shawls, always standing or walking upright with a jaunty posture, bones visible as white outlines, clothing in vivid folk-art colors
- **Ornate scrollwork and filigree**: Symmetrical curling vine patterns, spiraling tendrils, and flourishing scroll shapes in white, gold, or bright color filling negative space around the main elements — dense, symmetrical, and decorative, reminiscent of royal icing piping on sugar skulls
- **Lit candles in clay holders**: Small stubby candles with visible flames (teardrop shape in yellow-orange) sitting in round clay candle holders, often arranged in rows or semicircles, providing warm focal points against the dark background
- **Cross motifs**: Simple Latin crosses decorated with marigolds, roses, or icing patterns, used as framing devices or bullet markers — NOT religious in the somber sense, rather folk-art festive, covered in bright ornamentation
- **Heart shapes (corazones)**: Symmetrical hearts in blood red, magenta, or pink outlined in white or gold, often pierced by decorative daggers, wrapped in thorny vines, or filled with scrollwork — used as category markers or accent shapes
- **Monarch butterflies**: Orange-and-black butterflies (Danaus plexippus) with precise wing vein patterns, shown in profile or spread-wing, representing the returning souls — used as small accent figures or directional indicators
- **Skeleton hands and bones**: Individual skeletal hands in white outline gesturing, pointing, or holding objects — used as pointer icons, directional indicators, or framing elements; crossed tibias (shinbones) as X-shaped dividers
- **Ofrenda altar shelves**: Horizontal shelf lines (wooden planks or fabric-draped tables) stacked in tiers, each shelf holding arranged offerings — used as the structural grid for organizing content into horizontal rows
- **Roses and spider lilies**: Red roses with visible layered petals and green leaves, and red spider lilies with curling stamens, used alongside marigolds for floral accent variety, always with ornamental leaf and thorn details
- **Cobweb corner decorations**: Symmetrical spiderweb patterns in thin white line filling corner spaces of frames and panels, a reference to the spider-web papel picado motifs, used as purely decorative corner fills

## Visual Metaphor Mappings
| Abstract Concept | Dia de Muertos Metaphor |
|------------------|------------------------|
| Growth | A marigold shown in three stages — green bud, half-open orange, fully bloomed golden — each in a small papel-picado frame on a dark shelf |
| Speed / Velocity | A skeleton figure on a bicycle (bicicleta) with marigold petals streaming behind like a comet tail, on bone black ground |
| Connection | A garland of cempasuchil marigolds strung between two points — the traditional petal path that connects the living to the dead |
| Danger / Risk | A sugar skull with cracked forehead and red lightning-bolt fracture line, one eye socket dark and empty, surrounded by thorny rose vines |
| Discovery | A skeleton hand lifting a papel picado sheet to reveal something underneath — the sheet partially raised, content visible in the gap |
| Money / Cost | A small chest (cofre) overflowing with gold coins and marigold flowers, flanked by lit candles, sitting on an ofrenda shelf |
| Time | A clock face with skeleton hands (bone fingers) as the clock hands, marigold wreath around the dial, on midnight background |
| Security / Protection | A protective arch of cempasuchil marigolds and candles forming a gateway — the traditional floral arch of the ofrenda entrance |
| Communication | A skeleton musician playing a trumpet, with concentric sound arcs in marigold orange emanating from the bell of the instrument |
| Global / International | A globe rendered as a decorated sugar skull — continents as icing patterns, oceans as the bone-white ground, equator as a scrollwork band |
| Complexity | An intricate papel picado design with dozens of tiny punched-out shapes forming a dense overall pattern, requiring close inspection to read |
| Failure / Error | A broken clay candle holder in two pieces with the candle extinguished, a thin smoke wisp curling up in white line, on dark ground |
| Innovation | A lightbulb shape decorated as a sugar skull — filament as a scrollwork design, glass as the skull dome, base as the jaw — glowing with marigold-orange light rays |
| Balance | A skeleton figure (La Catrina) holding a balance scale with marigold flowers on each pan, the pans level, roses in her hat |
| Collaboration | Two skeleton figures in elegant attire dancing together (waltz pose), their bone fingers interlaced, marigold garlands draped between them |

## Typography
- **Primary Typeface**: Bold decorative serif or folk-art display face with slight hand-lettered feel — Playfair Display Black, Alfa Slab One, or a chunky ornamental serif; letterforms should feel festive, solid, and handcrafted
- **Title Treatment**: ALL CAPS in heavy weight, letters slightly expanded, rendered in marigold orange or altar gold on bone-black banner with scalloped papel-picado-style edges; 28-36pt equivalent; optionally adorned with small flower or scrollwork accents flanking the text
- **Body Labels**: Sentence case, bold weight, 12-16pt equivalent, always inside a papel-picado-bordered frame, a ribbon banner, or an ofrenda shelf panel — NEVER floating freely on the background
- **Number Callouts**: Bold numerals inside small sugar-skull-eye circles (concentric rings of color) or marigold blossom frames, 10-14pt, in white or gold on dark ground
- **Decorative Lettrine**: Optionally use large ornamental initial capitals decorated with scrollwork, flowers, or skeleton motifs as the first letter of a section
- **NO thin lightweight sans-serif typefaces**: This style demands bold, heavy, ornamental type with presence and festivity
- **NO text with gradient fills or 3D extrusion**: Text is flat color on flat ground — gold on black, white on black, or black on marigold, always within a decorated frame

## Anti-Patterns
- **NO somber, mournful, or gloomy tone — this is a CELEBRATION, not a funeral**: Dia de Muertos is joyful, colorful, and festive. Do NOT make it dark, scary, or sad. Skeletons are SMILING, DANCING, CELEBRATING. **NO weeping figures, NO black mourning veils, NO grief imagery**
- **NO horror or Halloween aesthetics**: Do NOT add blood drips, gore, zombies, stitched-flesh monsters, slasher imagery, or jump-scare compositions. This is Mexican folk art, NOT a haunted house. **NO blood splatter, NO torn flesh, NO horror-movie skulls with glowing red eyes**
- **NO photorealistic skulls or skeletons**: Skulls are DECORATIVE SUGAR SKULLS — smooth, white, symmetrical, covered in colorful icing scrollwork and flowers. They are NOT anatomically accurate medical specimens. **NO realistic bone texture, NO dark eye socket cavities, NO gritty decomposition**
- **NO empty negative space left bare**: The Dia de Muertos aesthetic is maximal and dense. Fill background areas with scrollwork filigree, scattered marigold petals, small stars, or papel picado patterns. **NO large areas of flat undecorated black**
- **NO desaturated, muted, or pastel colors**: The palette is BLAZING and SATURATED — hot pink, electric orange, vivid purple, acid green on jet black. Do NOT soften to dusty rose, peach, lavender, or sage. **NO washed-out colors, NO earth tones, NO gray-brown palette**
- **NO Western European religious iconography**: Do NOT add angel wings, church steeples, stained glass windows, or Protestant/Catholic funeral imagery. The crosses here are folk-art decorated, NOT austere religious symbols. **Keep it Mexican folk-art, NOT European sacred art**
- **NO minimalist or Swiss-style clean design**: This aesthetic is ORNAMENTAL AND DENSE. Every surface should carry decoration. Do NOT reduce to clean geometric shapes with white space. **NO Bauhaus, NO Helvetica grid, NO less-is-more**
- **NO scattered random elements without compositional purpose**: Although dense, the composition should be ORGANIZED — on altar shelves, on banner strings, in wreaths, in frames. Decoration fills intentional zones. **NO random confetti-toss of disconnected elements**
- **NO cartoon or anime simplification**: Sugar skulls and Catrina figures have a specific folk-art proportional canon — elegant, slightly elongated, detailed. Do NOT reduce to chibi, bobblehead, or simple emoji-style renderings. **NO kawaii skulls, NO cartoon skeletons**
- **NO gradients in the background or in major color fields**: Colors are FLAT and SATURATED. The black background is pure flat black. The marigold is pure flat orange. Color transitions happen at edges between shapes, NOT as smooth blends within a shape. **NO airbrushed color transitions, NO vignette edges**
- **NO 3D rendering or photographic lighting**: This is FLAT FOLK ART. Objects are outlined and filled with flat color. There are no cast shadows, no ambient occlusion, no specular highlights, no depth-of-field blur. **NO rendered 3D models**
- **NO modern tech-aesthetic mixing**: Do NOT add circuit boards, digital glitch effects, neon signs, holographic textures, or cyberpunk elements. The technology of this art is hand-cut paper, piped sugar icing, and hand-painted clay. **NO digital artifacts as style elements**
