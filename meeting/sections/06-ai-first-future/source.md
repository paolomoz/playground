# AI-First Future

## The Mandate
Fundamentally change how the team works using AI. Not just building AI for customers — transforming the team's own operating model.

## The Goal
Deliver **10x** by working **0.5x**. Not harder — smarter.

## Speed Is the Game-Changer
- Cloud Co-Work: idea to release in ~2 weeks, reportedly built entirely with Claude Code
- Experience Catalyst pivot: first prototype in 3-4 days, users within a week
- "What has fundamentally changed is the speed with which we can do it." — Karl Pauls

## How the Team Will Work
- Vibe coding everything possible
- AI-assisted planning and decision-making
- AI for customer engagement and content creation
- Every tool and process augmented with AI

## First Step: Invest in the Team
- Learn new ways of working through experimentation
- Build infographics, podcasts, tools — just by exploring
- Workshop next week: 80-90% focused on hands-on AI adoption
- Sessions with Lars Dierolf and Cedric scheduled

## The Invitation
> "Nothing is set in stone yet. This is an invite to all of you to help us shape and create." — Nicole Glauser

## What's Next
- Documents shared: mission, goals, slides, 6+1 value framework
- Workshop the following week to put it all into practice
- Team Slack channel for async discussion
