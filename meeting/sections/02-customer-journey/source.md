# The Customer Journey: Engineered Path

## The Continuous Loop
- Customer lifecycle viewed as a continuous loop, not a linear funnel
- Pre-sales (blue) → Post-sales (green) → back to expansion
- Enterprise customers have long-lasting engagements: renewal, upsell, expansion

## Two Lines: Status Quo vs. Engineered Path
- **Orange line** = what happens today (status quo)
- **Blue line** = the "engineered path" where engineering actively improves customer value
- The gap between the lines = the opportunity for the team

## Three Intervention Areas

### 1. Intelligent Value Discovery
Reaching the right customer, right stakeholder, with the right motivation and triggers at the right time. Making Adobe's information actionable for sales.

### 2. Personalisation
Showing outcome-specific value to customers. Not just "AEM will help" but "you will get HERE because of THIS." Digital Insights is the existing example.

### 3. Reducing Migration Barriers
The biggest barrier for enterprise adoption: moving to new technology. Huge complexity and cost — enterprise complexity, not product capabilities. Decreasing this barrier increases the business.
