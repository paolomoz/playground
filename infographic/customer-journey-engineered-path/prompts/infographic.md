Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: winding-roadmap
- **Style**: storybook-watercolor
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized

## Layout Guidelines (winding-roadmap)

Curved path showing journey with milestones and checkpoints.

- S-curve or winding path flowing left-to-right across the landscape frame
- Milestones along the path as checkpoints
- Clear start point (pre-sales) and the path loops back (continuous loop)
- Side elements showing the "two lines" concept (orange status quo vs blue engineered path)
- Three major milestone markers for the three intervention areas
- Scene elements along the path representing customer interactions
- Milestone labels at each point, path section names

## Style Guidelines (storybook-watercolor)

Soft hand-painted illustration with whimsical charm.

- **Color Palette**: Soft watercolor washes — muted blues, greens, warm earth tones. Watercolor paper texture, white or cream background. Deeper pigment pools for emphasis.
- **Visual Elements**: Visible brushstrokes, soft color bleeds and gradients, white space as design element, delicate line work over washes, natural organic shapes, dreamy atmospheric quality
- **Typography**: Elegant hand-lettering, watercolor-style text, flowing organic letterforms integrated with illustrations

Generate the infographic based on the content below:

# The Customer Journey: Engineered Path

A winding path showing the continuous customer lifecycle with three key intervention milestones.

## Path Start: Pre-Sales (Blue Zone)
- Customer lifecycle viewed as a continuous loop, not a linear funnel
- Pre-sales (blue) flowing into post-sales (green) and back to expansion
- Enterprise customers have long-lasting engagements: renewal, upsell, expansion

## The Two Lines Concept
- **Orange line** = status quo (what happens today) — shown as a lower, duller path
- **Blue line** = engineered path where engineering actively improves customer value — shown as a higher, brighter path
- The gap between the lines = the team's opportunity

## Milestone 1: Intelligent Value Discovery
- Reaching the right customer, right stakeholder, right motivation, right time
- Making Adobe's information actionable for sales
- Visual: Compass or magnifying glass icon at this milestone

## Milestone 2: Personalisation
- Showing outcome-specific value to customers
- Not just "AEM will help" but "you will get HERE because of THIS"
- Digital Insights is the existing example
- Visual: Target or personalized message icon at this milestone

## Milestone 3: Reducing Migration Barriers
- The biggest barrier for enterprise adoption: moving to new technology
- Huge complexity and cost — enterprise complexity, not product capabilities
- Decreasing this barrier increases the business
- Visual: Bridge or gate opening icon at this milestone

## Path Destination: Value Realisation → loops back to start
- The path curves back around, showing the continuous loop
- Renewal, upsell, expansion lead back to new engagement

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "The Customer Journey: Engineered Path"
- Path labels: "Pre-Sales", "Post-Sales", "Expansion", "Renewal"
- Line labels: "Status Quo" (orange), "Engineered Path" (blue)
- Milestone 1: "Intelligent Value Discovery"
- Milestone 2: "Personalisation"
- Milestone 3: "Reducing Migration Barriers"
- Loop label: "Continuous Loop"
