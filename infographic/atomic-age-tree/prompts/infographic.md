Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: tree-branching (top-down branching taxonomy)
- **Style**: mid-century modern — clean and professional
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- **CLEAN FLAT ILLUSTRATION**: Flat color fills, no gradients, no photorealism — but restrained and professional
- **MINIMAL DECORATION**: No scattered starbursts, atoms, boomerangs, or orbit shapes in the background. The background is clean warm cream. All visual interest comes from the tree structure itself.
- Clear hierarchy from root to branches to leaves
- Each node has a clean flat illustration and a label
- Generous whitespace — the design breathes

## Layout Guidelines

Top-down branching tree — clean and structured:
- Root node at top center — largest, most prominent
- 3 main branches spreading down and outward
- Each branch splits into 2-3 leaf nodes
- Connecting lines are clean thin charcoal — simple straight lines or gentle curves, no decorative embellishments at branch points
- Each node is a colored circle with a flat illustration inside
- Color-coded by branch
- Generous vertical and horizontal spacing

## Style Guidelines

Mid-century modern palette and flat illustration — the PROFESSIONAL side. Think Eames educational film, not diner placemat.

**Color Palette**:
- Background: Clean warm cream (#F5ECD7) — completely empty, no decorative filler
- Branch 1 (left): Turquoise (#1FBFB8)
- Branch 2 (center): Orange/coral (#E8601C, #E8837C)
- Branch 3 (right): Olive/mustard (#5E6B3A, #E5A535)
- Root node: Charcoal (#3D3D3D)
- Connectors: Thin charcoal lines — clean and simple
- Text: Charcoal on cream; white on colored nodes

**Visual Elements**:
- Clean circular nodes with flat illustrations inside
- Simple thin connecting lines between parent and child nodes
- Flat illustrated animals inside each leaf node — simple, clear, professional
- **NO scattered starbursts in background**
- **NO floating boomerangs or atomic symbols**
- **NO electron orbits as decoration**
- **NO decorative filler anywhere** — just the tree structure on clean cream
- The only visual elements are the nodes, lines, and labels

**Typography**:
- Clean sans-serif, professional and readable
- Node labels centered below each circle
- Root label larger and bolder
- Sublabels in smaller lighter weight
- Everything perfectly horizontal — no tilted text

# TYPES OF PETS
## A Field Guide

## TOP-DOWN TREE on clean cream background — NO background decorations

### ROOT NODE (top center, charcoal circle):
- Label: "PETS"
- Illustration: Simple heart icon

### BRANCH 1 — LEFT (turquoise): "DOGS"
- Main node: Flat dog face illustration, label "Dogs"
- Leaf 1: Running dog, label "Active Breeds" — "Labs, Retrievers, Huskies"
- Leaf 2: Resting dog, label "Calm Breeds" — "Bulldogs, Basset Hounds"
- Leaf 3: Tiny dog, label "Small Breeds" — "Chihuahuas, Pomeranians"

### BRANCH 2 — CENTER (orange/coral): "CATS"
- Main node: Flat cat face illustration, label "Cats"
- Leaf 1: Fluffy cat, label "Long Hair" — "Persians, Maine Coons"
- Leaf 2: Sleek cat, label "Short Hair" — "Siamese, Tabbies"

### BRANCH 3 — RIGHT (olive/mustard): "SMALL PETS"
- Main node: Flat fish/hamster illustration, label "Small Pets"
