Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: hub-spoke (central concept with radiating connections)
- **Style**: memphis (1980s Memphis Group postmodern design)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (square)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

### Hub-Spoke Layout

Central concept with radiating connections to related items.

**Structure:**
- Central hub (main concept) — large and prominent
- 6 spokes radiating outward evenly
- Nodes at spoke ends (related concepts)
- Even distribution around center

**Text Placement:**
- Title at top
- Core concept in center hub
- Spoke item labels at outer nodes
- Brief descriptions near nodes

## Style Guidelines

### Memphis Design Style (1980s Postmodern)

Loud, clashing 1980s postmodern design. Hot pink, electric blue, acid yellow, thick black outlines, zigzags, squiggly lines, terrazzo confetti. Deliberately "bad taste" maximalism.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Hot pink (#E84393), electric blue (#0984E3), acid yellow (#FDCB6E)
- Background: White with terrazzo confetti speckles
- Darks: True black for thick outlines
- Accents: Teal green (#00CEC9), coral red (#FF6348), lavender purple (#A29BFE), mint green (#55EFC4), tangerine orange (#E17055)

**MUST include:**
- **Thick black outlines** (4-6px) on every shape
- **Each spoke node a DIFFERENT geometric shape** (circle, triangle, rectangle, semicircle, diamond, star)
- **Each node a DIFFERENT clashing color and pattern fill**
- **Squiggly spoke lines** connecting hub to nodes — not straight
- **Terrazzo confetti** across the white background
- **Zigzag borders** around the composition
- **Bold geometric shapes** as standalone decorative elements
- Heavy bold sans-serif all-caps typography
- **NO gradients, NO shadows** — flat and outlined

**Anti-Patterns:**
- NOT corporate Memphis — loud, clashing, pattern-heavy
- NOT a clean mind map — must feel like Memphis furniture exploded into a diagram

# 6 PILLARS OF CREATIVE THINKING

Hub-spoke layout with "CREATIVE THINKING" at center and 6 pillars radiating outward.

## TITLE (top):
"6 PILLARS OF CREATIVE THINKING"
Bold Memphis typography on acid yellow banner with zigzag border, thick black outline.

## CENTER HUB:
"CREATIVE THINKING" — Large bold circle, hot pink background with terrazzo speckle inside, thick black outline, surrounded by radiating squiggly lines like an explosion of energy

## SPOKE 1 (top):
Shape: Circle, electric blue with polka dot fill
Label: "CURIOSITY"
Detail: "Ask why"

## SPOKE 2 (top-right):
Shape: Triangle, acid yellow with diagonal stripe fill
Label: "RISK-TAKING"
Detail: "Embrace failure"

## SPOKE 3 (bottom-right):
Shape: Rectangle, teal green with zigzag fill
Label: "PERSISTENCE"
Detail: "Keep iterating"

## SPOKE 4 (bottom):
Shape: Semicircle, coral red with crosshatch fill
Label: "PLAYFULNESS"
Detail: "Have fun"

## SPOKE 5 (bottom-left):
Shape: Diamond, lavender purple with squiggly fill
Label: "OBSERVATION"
Detail: "Look closely"

## SPOKE 6 (top-left):
Shape: Star, mint green with chevron fill
Label: "COLLABORATION"
Detail: "Build together"

**CRITICAL: Each spoke node must be a DIFFERENT geometric shape, DIFFERENT color, and DIFFERENT pattern fill. Spoke connecting lines should be thick, squiggly, and each a different color. Scatter bold geometric shapes (extra triangles, circles, zigzag strips) as decorative confetti in the negative space.**

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "6 PILLARS OF CREATIVE THINKING"
- Center: "CREATIVE THINKING"
- Spokes: "CURIOSITY" / "RISK-TAKING" / "PERSISTENCE" / "PLAYFULNESS" / "OBSERVATION" / "COLLABORATION"
