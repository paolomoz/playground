## Main Topic
Adobe's Engineered Customer Success approach uses AI-driven intelligence across three phases (Intelligent Value Discovery, Personalized Outcome, Immediate Realization) to accelerate path to value and unlock higher returns — with an estimated $1B (+50%) contractual value uplift compared to traditional approaches.

## Learning Objectives
After viewing this infographic, the viewer should understand:
1. How the three-phase Engineered Customer Success journey (Intelligent Value Discovery → Personalized Outcome → Immediate Realization) dramatically outperforms the traditional path in value realization
2. What specific tools and capabilities power each phase of the engineered approach (Fluffy Jaws, Digital Insights, Fast Migration, LLMO/Sites Optimizer)
3. How the continuous value flywheel spans Pre-Sales (Path to Value) through Post-Sales (Value Realization) across the full SS0–SS10 lifecycle

## Target Audience
- **Knowledge Level**: Intermediate — familiar with enterprise SaaS, customer success concepts
- **Context**: Sales/customer success leadership evaluating AI-driven customer engagement strategies
- **Expectations**: Understanding the ROI and mechanics of engineered intelligence in customer lifecycle

## Content Type Analysis
- **Data Structure**: Linear progression (3 phases) with comparison layer (traditional vs engineered), and detail breakdown per phase
- **Key Relationships**: Three phases map to specific tools/capabilities; both curves share the same timeline but diverge in outcome; Pre-Sales feeds Post-Sales via continuous flywheel
- **Visual Opportunities**: Two diverging growth curves, three-column pillar breakdown, process timeline with stages, large $1B callout stat

## Key Data Points (Verbatim)
- "$1B*"
- "+50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base"
- "60+ data sources"
- "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"
- "Fluffy Jaws: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources"
- "Competitive Intelligence: Customer properties running on competition"
- "Digital Insights: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer"
- "Fast migration: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier"
- "Outcome driven engineering: LLMO, Sites Optimizer"
- "Continuous value flywheel"
- Stages: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7 (Pre-Sales / Path to Value)
- Stages: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand (Post-Sales / Value Realization)

## Layout x Style Signals
- Content type: process-with-comparison → suggests linear-progression or winding-roadmap
- Tone: corporate strategy, high-impact → suggests corporate-memphis or technical-schematic
- Audience: business leadership → suggests corporate-memphis or bold-graphic
- Complexity: complex (12 points) → suggests dense layout with clear sections

## Design Instructions (from user input)
- Combine content from 2 slides into a single cohesive infographic
- Adobe branding context (red/dark green color elements in source)
- No specific style requested — recommend based on content

## Recommended Combinations
1. **linear-progression + corporate-memphis** (Recommended): Matches the three-phase journey structure perfectly. Corporate-memphis provides the clean, professional flat-vector aesthetic suited for business strategy content. The progression layout naturally shows the Traditional vs Engineered path divergence.
2. **winding-roadmap + bold-graphic**: The roadmap layout captures the journey from SS0 to SS10 with milestones at each phase. Bold-graphic adds visual punch to the $1B stat and phase transitions.
3. **bento-grid + technical-schematic**: Grid layout can dedicate sections to overview, each phase's details, the comparison curves, and the process stages. Technical-schematic gives it an engineering/precision feel matching the "Engineered Intelligence" theme.
4. **linear-progression + technical-schematic**: Combines the natural flow of progression with a blueprint/engineering aesthetic that reinforces the "engineered" concept.
5. **hub-spoke + corporate-memphis**: Central hub as "Engineered Customer Success" with spokes to each phase and their capabilities. Clean professional look.
