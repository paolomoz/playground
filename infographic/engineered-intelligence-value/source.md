## Slide 1: Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

**Engineered Customer Success**
Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns

### Three Phases (across the customer journey):
1. **Intelligent Value Discovery**
2. **Personalized Outcome**
3. **Immediate Realization**

### Two Growth Curves:
- **Traditional Path** (orange, lower curve) — gradual, linear growth
- **Engineered Path** (blue, higher curve) — steeper, exponential growth reaching "Top & Bottom Line"

### Key Metric:
- **$1B*** — *+50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base*

### Y-Axis: Value Realization Magnitude

### Process Framework:
- **Pre-Sales Process** → **Path to Value** (SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7)
- **Post-Sales Process** → **Value Realization** (SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand)

## Slide 2: Continuous customer context grounded in their success

### Three Pillars:

#### 1. Intelligent Value Discovery
- **Fluffy Jaws**: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources.
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Customer properties running on competition

#### 2. Personalized Outcome
- **Digital Insights**: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer

#### 3. Immediate Realization
- **Fast migration**: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- **Outcome driven engineering**: LLMO, Sites Optimizer

### Process Framework (same as Slide 1):
- **Pre-Sales Process** → **Path to Value** (SS0–SS7)
- **Post-Sales Process** → **Value Realization** (SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand)
