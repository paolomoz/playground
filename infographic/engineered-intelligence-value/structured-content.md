# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

## Overview
Adobe's Engineered Customer Success approach uses AI-driven intelligence across three phases to accelerate the path to value and unlock $1B in estimated additional contractual value (+50%) compared to traditional approaches.

## Learning Objectives
The viewer will understand:
1. How the Engineered Path dramatically outperforms the Traditional Path in value realization magnitude
2. What specific tools and capabilities power each of the three phases
3. How the continuous value flywheel spans the full Pre-Sales to Post-Sales lifecycle (SS0–SS10)

## Section 1: The Value Gap — Engineered vs Traditional

**Key Concept**: The Engineered Path delivers exponentially higher value realization compared to the Traditional Path, with an estimated $1B (+50%) contractual value uplift from AI-driven intelligence.

**Content**:
- Engineered Customer Success: Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns
- Traditional Path: gradual, linear growth (orange curve)
- Engineered Path: steeper, exponential growth reaching Top & Bottom Line (blue curve)
- $1B* — +50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base

**Visual Element**:
- Type: comparison chart / two diverging curves
- Subject: Two growth curves diverging from the same starting point — Traditional (flat/gradual) vs Engineered (steep/exponential)
- Treatment: Large prominent "$1B*" callout between the curves; arrow showing the gap

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers"
- Subhead: "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"
- Labels: "Traditional Path", "Engineered Path", "$1B*", "+50% estimated contractual value"
- Y-axis: "Value Realization Magnitude"

## Section 2: Intelligent Value Discovery

**Key Concept**: The first phase uses 60+ data sources and competitive intelligence to unlock deep customer context.

**Content**:
- Fluffy Jaws: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources.
- Competitive Intelligence: Customer properties running on competition

**Visual Element**:
- Type: icon cluster / data funnel
- Subject: Multiple data source streams converging into customer insights
- Treatment: Icon representing data aggregation, "60+" prominently displayed

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Intelligent Value Discovery"
- Labels: "Fluffy Jaws", "60+ data sources", "Competitive Intelligence"

## Section 3: Personalized Outcome

**Key Concept**: The second phase delivers outcome-driven definitions of opportunities tailored to each customer.

**Content**:
- Digital Insights: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer

**Visual Element**:
- Type: targeted insight icon
- Subject: Digital analytics/insights being personalized for each customer
- Treatment: Single focused element showing precision targeting

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Personalized Outcome"
- Labels: "Digital Insights", "Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer"

---

## Section 4: Immediate Realization

**Key Concept**: The third phase removes barriers to fast migration and drives outcomes through engineering tools like LLMO and Sites Optimizer.

**Content**:
- Fast migration: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- Outcome driven engineering: LLMO, Sites Optimizer

**Visual Element**:
- Type: acceleration / rocket icon
- Subject: Fast deployment removing barriers, engineering tools in action
- Treatment: Speed/momentum visual with tool labels

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Immediate Realization"
- Labels: "Fast migration", "Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier", "LLMO", "Sites Optimizer"

## Section 5: The Full Lifecycle — Continuous Value Flywheel

**Key Concept**: The three phases span the entire customer lifecycle from Pre-Sales (Path to Value, SS0–SS7) through Post-Sales (Value Realization, SS8–SS10) as a continuous value flywheel.

**Content**:
- Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7
- Post-Sales Process → Value Realization: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand
- Continuous value flywheel

**Visual Element**:
- Type: process timeline / stage progression
- Subject: Linear stage markers from SS0 to SS10 with Pre-Sales and Post-Sales labeled
- Treatment: Two-color segments (green for both sections matching source); flywheel arrow suggesting continuity

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "Continuous Value Flywheel"
- Labels: "Pre-Sales Process", "Path to Value", "Post-Sales Process", "Value Realization"
- Stage labels: "SS0"–"SS7", "SS8: Launch Health", "SS9: Run Operate", "SS10: Renew and Expand"

## Design Instructions

### Style Preferences
- Source uses Adobe brand colors: red accent, dark green for process bars, orange and blue for curves
- Professional, corporate strategy aesthetic
- Clean, high-impact visual with prominent $1B stat

### Layout Preferences
- Three-phase progression is the core structure
- Comparison element (Traditional vs Engineered curves) is a key visual
- Process timeline (SS0–SS10) at the bottom anchors the lifecycle

### Other Requirements
- Combine content from 2 separate slides into one cohesive infographic
- Maintain all verbatim data points and terminology
