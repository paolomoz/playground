Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: winding-roadmap
- **Style**: bold-graphic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- If content involves sensitive or copyrighted figures, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Winding roadmap showing the customer journey with milestones:
- S-curve or winding path from SS0 (start) to SS10 (destination)
- Three major milestone zones along the path: Intelligent Value Discovery, Personalized Outcome, Immediate Realization
- Pre-Sales section (SS0–SS7) as the first portion of the road
- Post-Sales section (SS8–SS10) as the final stretch
- Scene elements along the path showing tools and capabilities at each phase
- A prominent landmark or callout for the $1B value gap
- Start point labeled "Traditional Path" with a diverging "Engineered Path" showing the superior route
- Destination landmark: "Top & Bottom Line" impact

## Style Guidelines

Bold-graphic comic style with high contrast:
- Primary colors: Bold primaries — red, yellow, blue, black
- Background: White with halftone patterns and dramatic shadows
- Bold black outlines on all elements
- High contrast compositions
- Action lines and motion effects showing acceleration/momentum
- Impact fonts for emphasis, especially on "$1B*"
- Caption boxes for phase descriptions
- Comic panel borders optional but effective for separating phases
- Pop-art variant with halftone dots for visual energy

# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

This infographic shows a winding journey from traditional customer engagement to engineered intelligence, with dramatic value acceleration at each milestone.

## The Journey Start
Two paths diverge:
- **Traditional Path**: Slow, winding lower road
- **Engineered Path**: Fast-tracked upper road with accelerators
- The gap: **$1B*** (+50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base)

## Milestone 1: Intelligent Value Discovery
- **Fluffy Jaws**: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Customer properties running on competition

## Milestone 2: Personalized Outcome
- **Digital Insights**: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer

## Milestone 3: Immediate Realization
- **Fast migration**: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- **Outcome driven engineering**: LLMO, Sites Optimizer

## The Road Sections
- **Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value**: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7
- **Post-Sales Process → Value Realization**: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand
- **Continuous value flywheel** — the road loops back, showing ongoing value creation

Text labels (in en):
- Title: "Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers"
- Subtitle: "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"
- Milestone headers: "Intelligent Value Discovery", "Personalized Outcome", "Immediate Realization"
- Key stat (large, impact font): "$1B*", "+50% estimated contractual value"
- Path labels: "Traditional Path", "Engineered Path"
- Detail labels: "Fluffy Jaws", "60+ data sources", "Competitive Intelligence", "Digital Insights", "Fast migration", "LLMO", "Sites Optimizer"
- Process labels: "Pre-Sales Process", "Path to Value", "Post-Sales Process", "Value Realization", "Continuous value flywheel"
- Stage labels: "SS0"–"SS7", "SS8: Launch Health", "SS9: Run Operate", "SS10: Renew and Expand"
