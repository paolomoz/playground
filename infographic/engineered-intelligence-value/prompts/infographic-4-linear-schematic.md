Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression
- **Style**: technical-schematic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- If content involves sensitive or copyrighted figures, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Linear progression with engineering precision:
- Horizontal left-to-right flow through three phases
- Three major nodes connected by technical conduit/pipeline
- Above the progression: two diverging curve lines (Traditional vs Engineered) showing value gap
- Below each node: detailed specifications of tools and capabilities
- Bottom strip: Process stage indicators SS0–SS10 as a technical measurement scale
- Clear start (SS0/Pre-Sales) and end (SS10/Post-Sales) points
- Directional flow arrows between phases

## Style Guidelines

Technical-schematic blueprint aesthetic:
- Primary colors: Blues (#2563EB), teals, grays, white lines
- Background: Deep blue (#1E3A5F) with subtle grid pattern
- Accents: Amber highlights (#F59E0B) for $1B stat, cyan callouts
- Geometric precision throughout
- Blueprint/engineering drawing feel
- Dimension lines showing the value gap between curves
- Technical annotations with leader lines
- Clean sans-serif or stencil typography
- All-caps labels for major elements
- Consistent stroke weights
- The three phase nodes rendered as technical components/modules

# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

A blueprint-style linear progression showing the engineering architecture of Adobe's three-phase value acceleration system.

## Upper Layer: Value Curves
Two precisely drawn curves above the progression:
- **Traditional Path**: Lower, gradual growth curve
- **Engineered Path**: Upper, exponential growth curve
- Dimension line between curves: **$1B*** (+50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base)
- Both curves annotated with "Value Realization Magnitude" axis

## Phase Node 1: Intelligent Value Discovery
- **Fluffy Jaws**: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Customer properties running on competition
- Technical annotation: data aggregation module

## Phase Node 2: Personalized Outcome
- **Digital Insights**: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer
- Technical annotation: precision targeting module

## Phase Node 3: Immediate Realization
- **Fast migration**: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- **Outcome driven engineering**: LLMO, Sites Optimizer
- Technical annotation: deployment acceleration module

## Bottom Layer: Process Scale
- **Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value**: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7
- **Post-Sales Process → Value Realization**: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand
- **Continuous value flywheel** — feedback loop arrow from SS10 back to SS0

Text labels (in en):
- Title: "ENGINEERED INTELLIGENCE AND SPEED AS VALUE DRIVERS"
- Subtitle: "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"
- Phase headers: "INTELLIGENT VALUE DISCOVERY", "PERSONALIZED OUTCOME", "IMMEDIATE REALIZATION"
- Key stat: "$1B*", "+50% ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL VALUE"
- Curve labels: "TRADITIONAL PATH", "ENGINEERED PATH"
- Axis label: "VALUE REALIZATION MAGNITUDE"
- Detail labels: "Fluffy Jaws", "60+ data sources", "Competitive Intelligence", "Digital Insights", "Fast migration", "LLMO", "Sites Optimizer"
- Process labels: "PRE-SALES PROCESS", "PATH TO VALUE", "POST-SALES PROCESS", "VALUE REALIZATION", "CONTINUOUS VALUE FLYWHEEL"
- Stage labels: "SS0"–"SS7", "SS8: LAUNCH HEALTH", "SS9: RUN OPERATE", "SS10: RENEW AND EXPAND"
