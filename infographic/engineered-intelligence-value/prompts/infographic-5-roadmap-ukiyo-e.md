Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: winding-roadmap
- **Style**: ukiyo-e (Hokusai variant)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy
- This should feel INSPIRING, majestic, powerful — showing the triumph of engineered intelligence over traditional approaches

## Text Requirements

- Brush calligraphy style for titles and headlines
- Clean, readable labels with ink-brush character
- Text integrated into composition as banners, cartouches, or scroll elements
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Winding roadmap showing the journey from traditional to engineered value realization:
- Two paths flowing left to right across the landscape, like two rivers:
  - **Traditional Path** (lower, slower): A thin, winding stream moving slowly through flat lowlands — gradual, limited growth
  - **Engineered Path** (upper, powerful): A mighty river surging upward through dramatic landscape — steep, exponential growth, reaching the peaks
- The gap between the two paths grows dramatically as they progress, representing the $1B value gap
- Three landmark milestones along the Engineered Path, depicted as stations along the Tokaido Road:
  1. **Intelligent Value Discovery** — depicted as a great observatory or lighthouse on a cliff
  2. **Personalized Outcome** — depicted as a master craftsman's workshop
  3. **Immediate Realization** — depicted as a powerful waterfall or rapid current surging forward
- At the bottom, the journey timeline: Pre-Sales (SS0–SS7, Path to Value) flowing into Post-Sales (SS8–SS10, Value Realization) — shown as stepping stones across the river
- The destination on the right: "Top & Bottom Line" shown as a majestic mountain peak bathed in sunrise light
- The "$1B*" stat prominently displayed between the two paths as a dramatic callout

## Style Guidelines

Ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock print aesthetic (浮世絵) — Hokusai variant with dramatic nature and dynamic movement:
- Primary colors: Indigo blue (ai-iro) for the Engineered Path, vermillion red/orange for the Traditional Path, Prussian blue (bero-ai) for sky and water
- Background: Warm cream (unprinted paper white) with bokashi gradient sky — dawn/sunrise representing possibility
- Accents: Safflower pink (beni), yellow ochre (odo), verdigris green (rokusho), sumi black
- Bold, confident black outlines (sumi ink) with varying line weights
- Flat color areas with no gradients within shapes
- Colors appear layered, as if printed sequentially
- Subtle color bleeding at edges (bokashi effect for skies and water)
- Visible wood grain texture suggestion
- Paper texture undertone, matte non-glossy appearance
- Traditional cloud patterns (kumo) separating the three phases
- Stylized wave patterns for the Engineered Path showing power and momentum
- Mount Fuji or dramatic peaks as the destination — "Top & Bottom Line"
- The Traditional Path as a calm, flat stream; the Engineered Path as a dynamic, powerful river with Hokusai-style waves
- Brush calligraphy for all titles
- The overall feel: majestic, awe-inspiring, showing the dramatic difference between mediocrity and engineered excellence

# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

A majestic ukiyo-e landscape showing two paths through dramatic Japanese scenery — the Traditional Path (a slow stream through lowlands) versus the Engineered Path (a mighty river surging to the peaks). Three great landmarks mark the journey of engineered customer success.

## The Two Paths — The Great Divergence
- **Engineered Customer Success**: Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns
- **Traditional Path**: Gradual, slow growth — a meandering stream through flat terrain
- **Engineered Path**: Steep, exponential growth — a powerful river surging through dramatic landscape
- **The Gap**: $1B* — +50% estimated contractual value from AI-driven intelligence on global customer base
- The two paths start near each other but diverge dramatically — the Engineered Path rises like a great wave

## Milestone 1: Intelligent Value Discovery
- Fluffy Jaws: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources
- Competitive Intelligence: Customer properties running on competition
- Scene: A great lighthouse or observatory on a cliff, scholars studying scrolls, telescopes surveying the landscape
- This is the phase of deep seeing — understanding the customer through data

## Milestone 2: Personalized Outcome
- Digital Insights: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer
- Scene: A master craftsman's workshop, precision tools, each piece individually crafted
- This is the phase of precise creation — tailoring the path for each customer

## Milestone 3: Immediate Realization
- Fast migration: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- Outcome driven engineering: LLMO, Sites Optimizer
- Scene: A powerful waterfall or rapids surging forward, barriers breaking away, ships launching
- This is the phase of unstoppable momentum — barriers removed, value flowing freely

## The Journey Timeline — Stepping Stones
- Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value: SS0 through SS7 (stepping stones in calm water)
- Post-Sales Process → Value Realization: SS8 Launch Health, SS9 Run Operate, SS10 Renew and Expand (stepping stones in the powerful current)
- Continuous value flywheel — the river flows eternally

## The Destination: Top & Bottom Line
- The Engineered Path reaches the highest peaks — Mount Fuji bathed in golden sunrise
- Value Realization Magnitude reaches its zenith
- The Traditional Path remains in the lowlands
