Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: bento-grid
- **Style**: technical-schematic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- If content involves sensitive or copyrighted figures, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Bento-grid modular layout with varied cell sizes:
- Hero cell (2x2 or spanning full width): Title + two diverging curves (Traditional vs Engineered) with $1B gap callout
- Three equal cells in a row: One for each phase (Intelligent Value Discovery, Personalized Outcome, Immediate Realization) with their tools/capabilities
- One wide cell at bottom: Process timeline SS0–SS10 showing Pre-Sales → Post-Sales lifecycle with Continuous Value Flywheel
- Clear cell boundaries with consistent padding
- Visual hierarchy through cell size — hero cell largest, detail cells medium, timeline wide but shorter

## Style Guidelines

Technical-schematic blueprint aesthetic:
- Primary colors: Blues (#2563EB), teals, grays, white lines
- Background: Deep blue (#1E3A5F) or light gray with grid pattern
- Accents: Amber highlights (#F59E0B) for key stats, cyan callouts
- Geometric precision throughout — clean vector shapes
- Grid pattern or isometric angle subtly in background
- Dimension lines and measurement-style annotations
- Technical stencil or clean sans-serif typography
- All-caps labels for headers
- Floating labels with leader lines pointing to elements
- Consistent stroke weights across all elements

# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

A technical blueprint-style bento grid showing the architecture of Adobe's Engineered Customer Success approach.

## Hero Cell: The Value Architecture
Two growth curves showing engineering-level precision:
- **Traditional Path**: Linear, gradual growth curve
- **Engineered Path**: Exponential growth curve reaching Top & Bottom Line
- Gap annotation: **$1B*** (+50% estimated contractual value. From AI driven intelligence on global customer base)
- Subtitle: "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"

## Cell: Intelligent Value Discovery
- **Fluffy Jaws**: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Customer properties running on competition
- Visual: data streams converging into insight node

## Cell: Personalized Outcome
- **Digital Insights**: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer
- Visual: targeted precision diagram

## Cell: Immediate Realization
- **Fast migration**: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- **Outcome driven engineering**: LLMO, Sites Optimizer
- Visual: acceleration vectors, deployment schematic

## Bottom Cell: Process Architecture
- **Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value**: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7
- **Post-Sales Process → Value Realization**: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand
- **Continuous value flywheel** connecting end to beginning

Text labels (in en):
- Title: "ENGINEERED INTELLIGENCE AND SPEED AS VALUE DRIVERS"
- Subtitle: "Accelerates the path to value and unlocks higher returns"
- Phase headers: "INTELLIGENT VALUE DISCOVERY", "PERSONALIZED OUTCOME", "IMMEDIATE REALIZATION"
- Key stat: "$1B*", "+50% ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL VALUE"
- Curve labels: "TRADITIONAL PATH", "ENGINEERED PATH"
- Detail labels: "Fluffy Jaws", "60+ data sources", "Competitive Intelligence", "Digital Insights", "Fast migration", "LLMO", "Sites Optimizer"
- Process labels: "PRE-SALES PROCESS", "PATH TO VALUE", "POST-SALES PROCESS", "VALUE REALIZATION", "CONTINUOUS VALUE FLYWHEEL"
- Stage labels: "SS0"–"SS7", "SS8: LAUNCH HEALTH", "SS9: RUN OPERATE", "SS10: RENEW AND EXPAND"
