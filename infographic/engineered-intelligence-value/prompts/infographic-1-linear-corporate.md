Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression
- **Style**: corporate-memphis
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- If content involves sensitive or copyrighted figures, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Sequential progression showing a three-phase journey from left to right:
- Linear horizontal arrangement with three major nodes/phases
- Connecting path between nodes with directional flow indicators
- Clear start point (Pre-Sales) and end point (Post-Sales/Value Realization)
- Nodes at each key phase: Intelligent Value Discovery → Personalized Outcome → Immediate Realization
- A comparison element showing two curves (Traditional vs Engineered) above or integrated with the progression
- Process stage indicators (SS0–SS10) along the bottom as a timeline

## Style Guidelines

Corporate-memphis flat vector aesthetic:
- Primary colors: Bright, saturated — purple, orange, teal, yellow
- Background: White or light pastels
- Flat vector illustrations with disproportionate human figures or abstract shapes
- Floating geometric elements as accents
- No outlines, solid fills
- Clean sans-serif typography, bold headings
- Professional but friendly tone

# Engineered Intelligence and Speed as Value Drivers

This infographic shows how Adobe's Engineered Customer Success approach uses AI-driven intelligence across three phases to dramatically outperform traditional approaches, delivering an estimated $1B (+50%) in additional contractual value.

## The Value Gap
Two growth curves diverge from the same starting point:
- **Traditional Path**: Gradual, linear growth (lower curve)
- **Engineered Path**: Steep, exponential growth reaching Top & Bottom Line impact (upper curve)
- The gap between them represents **$1B*** in estimated contractual value (+50% from AI driven intelligence on global customer base)

## Phase 1: Intelligent Value Discovery
- **Fluffy Jaws**: Customer context unlock through 60+ data sources
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Customer properties running on competition

## Phase 2: Personalized Outcome
- **Digital Insights**: Outcome driven definition of the opportunity for the customer

## Phase 3: Immediate Realization
- **Fast migration**: Remove cost and time uncertainty barrier
- **Outcome driven engineering**: LLMO, Sites Optimizer

## Lifecycle Process
- **Pre-Sales Process → Path to Value**: SS0, SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6, SS7
- **Post-Sales Process → Value Realization**: SS8: Launch Health, SS9: Run Operate, SS10: Renew and Expand
- **Continuous value flywheel** connecting all stages
