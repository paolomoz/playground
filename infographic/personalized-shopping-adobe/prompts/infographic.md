Create a bold, artistic infographic that looks like a creative Photoshop composition — NOT a slide, NOT a card layout, NOT a UI mockup. This is a POSTER. A piece of visual art that tells a story through layered imagery, creative effects, and bold typography. Think Adobe MAX keynote visual, fashion editorial spread, or concert poster — not a presentation deck.

## CRITICAL: THIS IS ART, NOT A SLIDE

NO cards. NO bento grids. NO UI elements. NO pill buttons. NO rounded rectangles. NO card shadows.

This is a full-bleed, edge-to-edge creative composition. Imagine a designer opened Photoshop and spent hours layering, blending, masking, and compositing to create a single powerful image.

## THE COMPOSITION

The image is split into two contrasting worlds that BLEED INTO EACH OTHER at the center — no hard divider, but a dramatic transition.

### LEFT HALF — "Sarah's World" (warm, alive, creative explosion)

A vibrant creative collage filling the left side edge-to-edge:

- A bold photographic portrait of a mother — shot from a low angle or dramatic perspective, warm golden and pink lighting on her face, she's looking off to the side with purpose
- DOUBLE EXPOSURE effect: her silhouette filled with images of family life — a dinner table scene, children playing, a kitchen, warm golden light bleeding through
- Around her, FLOATING COLLAGE ELEMENTS with Photoshop drop shadows and slight rotations: a colorful illustrated blender, a steaming soup bowl with hand-drawn steam lines, smoothie glasses in pop-art colors, small illustrated children running
- OVERSIZED hand-painted brush stroke text splashed across the imagery: "SMOOTHIES" in hot pink (#FEA8EC) brush script, "SOUP" in yellow (#FBE87A), "FAMILY" in bold red (#EB1000) — text AS art, layered over and behind the photography
- Halftone dot pattern texture overlaid at 20% opacity on parts of the image
- Sparkle/star elements (✦) scattered in gold
- Paint splatter and ink drip effects in red and pink along edges
- Color overlay: warm tones — pinks, oranges, golds, reds

### CENTER — The collision zone

Where the two halves meet, there's a dramatic BLEND:
- A torn paper edge effect, or a jagged diagonal rip
- Or a bold vertical red (#EB1000) paint stroke / brush swipe separating the two worlds
- The word "DISCONNECT" stamped across the tear in bold black distressed type, like a rubber stamp or stencil

### RIGHT HALF — "The Generic Page" (cold, lifeless, monotone)

A stark contrast — desaturated, mechanical, oppressive:

- A cold, blue-grey (#E8E8E8) desaturated treatment — as if the color was sucked out
- Dense rows of tiny text and numbers filling the space like a wall — a specification table rendered as visual texture, not readable, just oppressively dense
- The number "40" rendered ENORMOUS in bold black, overlapping the spec table — the number itself as a visual element, partially transparent, casting a shadow
- Faint ghost outlines of a person (any person, everyone, nobody specific) behind the data — suggesting the user is invisible to the system
- Grid lines and ruled lines overlaid — mechanical, rigid, lifeless
- Monochrome except for occasional cold blue (#1373E5) accents
- No warmth, no personality, no Photoshop creativity — DELIBERATELY dull compared to the left

### TYPOGRAPHY TREATMENT — integrated into the art

- "THE PROBLEM" across the top in MASSIVE bold Adobe Clean Black — not in a header bar, but OVERLAID on the image itself, partially behind some collage elements, partially in front of others. White text with a subtle shadow, or red text knockout. The type is part of the composition, not a label on top.
- "what if the website already knew?" at the bottom in #EB1000 Adobe red, large and bold, spanning the full width — this is the emotional punch line. Could be slightly angled, or have a red paint stroke behind it.
- Key phrases from the content appear as layered typographic elements throughout: "one loves smoothies" handwritten in pink, "40 rows she has to decode" in cold blue mechanical type on the right, "same product page as everyone else" stamped in grey

### PHOTOSHOP EFFECTS TO USE

- Double exposure / blend modes (multiply, screen, overlay)
- Color grading split: warm left (orange/pink tones), cold right (blue/grey tones)
- Paint splatter and brush stroke elements
- Torn paper / ripped edge effects at the center
- Halftone dot textures
- Drop shadows on floating collage elements
- Gaussian blur on background elements for depth
- Grain / noise texture overlay on the whole image for editorial quality
- Vignette darkening at edges

## COLOR DIRECTION

- Left side: #EB1000 red, #FEA8EC pink, #FBE87A yellow, #B9E0DB mint, warm skin tones, golden light — ALIVE
- Right side: #E8E8E8 grey, #CCCCCC, #1373E5 cold blue, desaturated — DEAD
- Typography: #000000 black, #FFFFFF white, #EB1000 red — HIGH CONTRAST
- Overall: dramatic color split from warm to cold across the image

## What This Must NOT Be

- NOT a slide with cards, grids, or UI elements — this is a POSTER / ART PIECE
- NOT clean and organized — this is layered, messy-in-a-good-way, creative collage
- NOT a template — this looks like a one-of-a-kind Photoshop creation
- NOT flat — it has depth from shadows, blur, layering, and blend effects
- NOT text-on-background — typography is WOVEN into the imagery, overlapping, behind and in front of visual elements
