# The Golden Age of Art Deco (1920s-1930s)

## Origins
Art Deco emerged from the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris. The movement drew from Cubism, Futurism, and ancient Egyptian, Aztec, and African art. It rejected the flowing organic forms of Art Nouveau in favor of bold geometric abstraction and machine-age precision.

## Key Characteristics

The style has seen major revivals: the 1960s-70s nostalgia wave, the 1980s postmodern embrace, and the 2013 Great Gatsby film reigniting popular interest. Over 300 Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach's Historic District form the largest collection of Art Deco architecture in the world.
