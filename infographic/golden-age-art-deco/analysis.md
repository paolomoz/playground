## Recommended Combinations
1. **bento-grid + art-deco** (Recommended): Multi-faceted content maps naturally to bento compartments; Art Deco's geometric panels and gold borders create a jewelry-box feel
2. **linear-progression + art-deco**: Timeline content suits horizontal progression; Art Deco's frieze-like ornamental bands enhance the temporal flow
3. **hierarchical-layers + art-deco**: Ziggurat-style stepped layers perfectly embody Art Deco's architectural DNA; good for grouping by importance
