Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: bento-grid (simplified — only 5 large cells, generous spacing)
- **Style**: art-deco
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- **CLARITY OVER DENSITY**: Use fewer cells with more breathing room. Each cell should have ONE clear idea with large readable text and a strong visual. White space (or rather, black space) is a feature, not waste.
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy — the eye should move easily from title → hero → supporting cells → timeline
- Minimal text per cell: one headline + 2-3 short labels maximum. Let the visuals do the work.
- All text must be large enough to read comfortably at reduced size

## Layout Guidelines

Simplified bento grid with only 5 spacious cells:

**Structure**:
- Only 5 cells total (not 7+). Each cell is generous in size.
- Wide gutters between cells (visible black space with gold trim)
- Hero cell is dominant (roughly 40% of the composition)
- Remaining 4 cells are evenly balanced
- Ornamental Art Deco outer border frames everything

**IMPORTANT — Breathing room**:
- Each cell has significant internal padding
- Text never crowds the edges
- Illustrations have space around them
- The black background between cells acts as a luxurious negative space element

## Style Guidelines

Opulent geometric glamour of the 1920s-30s — polished gold lines on deep black, sunburst fans, stepped ziggurat forms, chevron borders. Chrysler Building lobby meets Great Gatsby ballroom.

**Color Palette**:
- Primary: Rich gold (#D4AF37), deep black (#0A0A0A), warm ivory cream (#F5F0E1)
- Jewel accents: Emerald green (#046307), sapphire blue (#0F2080)
- Text: Gold or cream on black

**Visual Elements**:
- Thick polished gold lines forming geometric frames and dividers — gleaming metallic sheen
- Radiating sunburst fans as decorative accents
- Stepped ziggurat silhouettes
- Chevron and zigzag border trim
- Symmetrical bilateral composition
- Bold geometric outer border frame

**Typography**:
- Bold condensed sans-serif, ALL-CAPS headlines with generous letter-spacing
- Gold metallic finish on type
- Large, readable text — prioritize legibility over density
- NO script fonts, NO handwritten feel

**Anti-Patterns**:
- NOT busy or cluttered — this version prioritizes clarity and breathing room
- NOT a flat corporate template — must feel genuinely luxurious
- NOT cramped with text — each cell has ONE clear concept with minimal labels
