## Style Guidelines

Opulent geometric glamour of the 1920s-30s — polished gold lines slicing across deep black backgrounds, stepped ziggurat silhouettes rising in perfect symmetry, radiating sunburst fans catching the light, and jewel-toned panels framed in gleaming brass. This is the Chrysler Building lobby, a Great Gatsby ballroom, a luxury ocean liner's first-class lounge — angular, lavish, and unapologetically dramatic.

**Color Palette**:
- Primary: Rich gold/brass (#C5A55A, #D4AF37), deep obsidian black (#0A0A0A), warm ivory cream (#F5F0E1)
- Background: Dense black with subtle sheen — never flat matte
- Metallics: Polished gold (#D4AF37), brushed brass (#C5A55A), gleaming silver/chrome (#C0C0C0)
- Jewel accents: Emerald green (#046307), sapphire blue (#0F2080), ruby red (#9B111E), amethyst purple (#5B2C6F)
- Text: Gold or cream on black; white on jewel-toned panels

**Use the Gatsby variant**: Maximum gold-on-black glamour. Thick gold lines forming geometric frames, radiating sunbursts, chevron borders, fan motifs — everything gleams against velvety black like a 1920s invitation.

**Visual Elements** (apply throughout):
- Thick polished gold lines forming bold geometric frames, borders, and dividers on deep black backgrounds — lines that gleam with metallic sheen, not flat yellow
- Radiating sunburst fans: thin gold lines fanning outward from a semicircular base, like a rising sun or peacock tail
- Stepped/terraced ziggurat silhouettes: forms that ascend in symmetrical staircase tiers
- Fan/scallop patterns: overlapping semicircles in rows creating a fish-scale motif
- Chevron and zigzag borders: sharp V-shapes repeating in bands
- Fluted vertical lines: tight parallel grooves creating rhythm and texture
- Symmetrical bilateral compositions: mirrored around a strong central axis
- High-contrast metallic surfaces: polished gold catching highlights against matte black
- Jewel-toned accent panels: rectangles filled with emerald, sapphire, or ruby, set like precious stones in gold framework
- Bold geometric border framing the entire composition

**Typography**:
- Bold condensed sans-serif, tall narrow commanding letterforms
- ALL-CAPS for headlines with generous letter-spacing
- Gold metallic finish on type against black backgrounds
- Text framed within gold geometric cartouches
- NO script fonts, NO handwritten feel — everything is architectural and authoritative

**Anti-Patterns**:
- NOT a flat corporate template with gold accent lines
- NOT Art Nouveau (no flowing organic curves)
- NOT a generic "gold border on black" — gold elements must form specific Art Deco motifs (sunbursts, fans, chevrons, zigzags, stepped forms)
- Must look like the lobby of the Chrysler Building or a 1920s luxury hotel ballroom, not a PowerPoint template

**Categories compositional pattern**: Distinct geometric panels (rectangles, pointed arches, or fan-topped frames) arranged in a symmetrical grid, each bordered in gold and filled with its own jewel-tone background — like an Art Deco stained glass window with compartmentalized geometric panels.
