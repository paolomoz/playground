## Topic: AI Evolution Framework — 4 Levels to AI Native Team

A pyramid/hierarchy layout showing 4 maturity levels stacking upward. The key insight: Level 4 is NOT just "everyone at Level 3" — it's shared infrastructure and culture.

## LAYOUT

### TOP: Black hero bar
- "AI Evolution Framework" in massive bold white, centered
- Subtitle in #CCCCCC: "4 levels to AI native team"
- Small pill tags: "#culture" in #B9E0DB mint, "#learning" in #FEA8EC pink

### Thin #EB1000 red banner strip

### MAIN: 4-level pyramid on #F5F5F5 ground

4 horizontal tiers stacking upward, each tier a clean card. Bottom tier is widest, top is narrowest — classic pyramid shape. Each tier gets bolder and more visually intense as you go up.

**LEVEL 1 — "AI User" (bottom, widest tier)**
#F5F5F5 light grey card with #E8E8E8 border. The starting point — most of the team is here.
- "LEVEL 1" in small #EB1000 red label
- "AI User" in bold #000000 headline
- Body in #666666: "Uses AI tools when prompted. Copy-paste into ChatGPT. Occasional assistance."
- A marker: "← most of the team is here" in #EB1000 red italic
- Visual: simple icon of a person at a desk with a chat bubble

**LEVEL 2 — "AI First" (second tier)**
White card. Narrower than Level 1.
- "LEVEL 2" in small #8B2ADA purple label
- "AI First" in bold #000000 headline
- Body in #666666: "AI is the default starting point. Every task begins with 'how would AI approach this?'"
- Visual: person with multiple AI tool windows around them

**LEVEL 3 — "AI Native Individual" (third tier)**
#1373E5 blue card with white text. Narrower still.
- "LEVEL 3" in white label
- "AI Native Individual" in bold white headline
- Body in white: "AI is embedded in workflow. Custom prompts, agents, automations. Thinks in human+AI systems."
- "TARGET: every individual here" in #FBE87A yellow bold
- Visual: person merged with AI elements, flowing together

**LEVEL 4 — "AI Native Team" (top, narrowest tier)**
#000000 black card with dramatic presence. The pinnacle.
- "LEVEL 4" in #EB1000 red label
- "AI Native Team" in bold white headline
- Body in #CCCCCC: "Shared infrastructure and culture that makes AI-native the default — even for new joiners"
- Visual: team/group icon connected by glowing network lines

### KEY INSIGHT CALLOUT
Below the pyramid, a special #EB1000 red card spanning medium width, centered:
- "≠" symbol large in white
- "Level 4 is NOT 'everyone is Level 3'" in bold white
- "It's shared infrastructure + culture that makes AI-native the default" in white
- This is the critical takeaway — make it visually punchy

### BOTTOM
"from AI user to AI native" in bold #EB1000 red, centered, large

## CLEAN DESIGN RULES
- Pyramid tiers are clean horizontal cards, narrowing as they go up
- Each level has a distinct color identity that intensifies upward: grey → white → blue → black
- Level numbers in red are small anchors, headlines are the hero text
- The "key insight" callout at the bottom breaks the pattern intentionally — it's the punchline
- NOT a collage, NOT messy — structured vertical ascent
- Generous padding within each tier
- The red marker on Level 1 ("most of the team is here") creates urgency
- The yellow callout on Level 3 ("TARGET") creates aspiration
