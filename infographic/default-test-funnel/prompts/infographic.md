### MAIN: 4 floating cards flowing left to right, each getting SMALLER

Cards decrease in width from left to right, suggesting a funnel narrowing. A lime green squiggle line flows between them connecting the stages. Each card floats at a slightly different height.

**CARD 1 — "1,000 Ideas" (largest, leftmost)**
Large white card with soft shadow, slight tilt.
- "1,000" in MASSIVE bold #FF6B8A pink
- "ideas" in #1A1A2E below it
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Brainstorms, shower thoughts, napkin sketches, 3am voice memos"
- A colorful mosaic of tiny icons inside (lightbulbs, sticky notes, pencils) — visual density
- Yellow smiley sticker floating nearby
- Pink hearts scattered around

**CARD 2 — "100 Experiments" (medium)**
Smaller white card with pale lilac (#E8D5F5) tint.
- "100" in bold #5B4FD6 indigo
- "experiments" in #1A1A2E
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Test the riskiest assumptions first. Kill what doesn't work."
- Icons of test tubes, A/B split screens, prototypes
- Holographic star nearby

**CARD 3 — "10 Products" (smaller)**
Smaller white card with green (#00B894) top accent bar.
- "10" in bold #00B894 green
- "products" in #1A1A2E
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Built, tested, iterated. Real users, real feedback."
- Icons of phone mockups and charts

**CARD 4 — "1 Launch" (smallest, rightmost)**
Small white card with an indigo (#5B4FD6) glow/border, floating highest with deepest shadow. The star of the show.
- "1" in ENORMOUS bold #5B4FD6 indigo
- "launch" in #1A1A2E
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Ship it. The one that survived."
- A rocket icon or confetti burst
- Multiple holographic 3D stars clustered here
- Yellow smiley celebrating
- A "🚀" or rocket illustration

### DECORATIVE ELEMENTS
- Lime green squiggle line flowing left to right between all 4 cards like a playful river
- Holographic 3D stars increasing in density from left to right (more stars = closer to launch)
- Yellow smileys at start and end
- Pink hearts scattered throughout
- Small arrow indicators between cards

### BOTTOM
"every big thing started small" in bold #5B4FD6 indigo, centered

## DESIGN RULES
- Cards shrink dramatically from left to right — the visual narrowing IS the funnel
- Numbers are the hero visual — massive, colorful, bold
- Color palette simplifies as you move right: pink → purple → green → indigo
- Lime squiggles connect the flow playfully
- NOT corporate, NOT dark — warm, playful, startup energy
