Create a clean, high-contrast infographic in Adobe's design language. Bold structure, vibrant imagery, not messy.

## Style: Clean Adobe — structured, bold, professional
- BLACK (#000000) hero section with massive white headline
- Thin #EB1000 red banner strip
- Clean sections with proper spacing
- Vibrant photographic imagery CONTAINED in clean sections
- Adobe Clean font: Black for headlines, Regular for body in #666666
- Proper greys: #F5F5F5, #E8E8E8, #666666

## Topic: From 10,000 Ideas to 1 Product — The Innovation Funnel

Funnel layout showing ideas being filtered down to a single shipped product.

## LAYOUT

### TOP: Black hero bar
- "The Innovation Funnel" in massive bold white, centered
- Subtitle in #CCCCCC: "From 10,000 ideas to 1 shipped product"

### Thin #EB1000 red banner strip

### MAIN: Horizontal funnel on #F5F5F5 ground

4 sections flowing left to right, each getting NARROWER and more focused. Use cards or contained blocks that visually narrow:

**SECTION 1 — "10,000 raw ideas" (widest)**
Large white card. Colorful grid of tiny doodle icons (lightbulbs, sticky notes, sketches) as a vivid photographic mosaic. The number "10,000" in MASSIVE bold #EB1000 red. Body in #666666: "Every innovation starts as a spark. Most won't survive." Full accent color palette — maximum visual energy but CONTAINED in the card.

**SECTION 2 — "1,000 concepts"**
Medium card. Cleaner — wireframes, sketches, organized sticky notes. Number "1,000" in bold #8B2ADA purple. Body: "Ideas shaped into testable concepts." Fewer colors, more structure.

**SECTION 3 — "100 prototypes"**
Smaller card. Product mockups, 3D renders, polished screens. Number "100" in bold #1373E5 blue. Body: "Built, tested, iterated, refined."

**SECTION 4 — "1 shipped" (tightest)**
Small #000000 black card with dramatic product photo. Number "1" in ENORMOUS white. "shipped." in #EB1000 red below. Minimal, confident, final.

**Visual narrowing**: Cards decrease in width from left to right. Or use a subtle triangular/funnel shape connecting them.

### BOTTOM
"from chaos to clarity" in bold #EB1000 red, centered

## CLEAN DESIGN RULES
- Each funnel stage is a clean, distinct section — NOT overlapping collage
- Numbers are the hero visual element at each stage — big, bold, typographic
- Color palette simplifies as you move right: rainbow → purple → blue → black+red
- Generous spacing, clean grid
- NOT messy, NOT torn paper, NOT paint splatters
