Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: bento-grid (5 spacious cells, generous spacing)
- **Style**: atomic-age / mid-century modern illustration
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- **FLAT ILLUSTRATION STYLE**: Everything must look like a page from a 1955 illustrated guidebook — flat color fills, no gradients, no photorealism, no drop shadows
- Clean, airy composition with generous cream-colored negative space between cells
- Each cell has ONE clear idea, large readable text, and a charming illustration
- Playful and optimistic tone — this should make people smile

## Layout Guidelines

Simplified bento grid — 5 spacious cells on a warm cream background:
- Wide gutters between cells with starburst decorative accents in the gaps
- Each cell has a colored background (rotating through turquoise, orange, mustard, olive, coral)
- Thin charcoal outlines around each cell
- Starburst and boomerang shapes as decorative flourishes between cells

**IMPORTANT — Breathing room**: Generous internal padding. The cream background shows through everywhere. Nothing feels cramped.

## Style Guidelines

Mid-century modern flat illustration — the Atomic Age as joyful graphic design.

**Color Palette**:
- Backgrounds: Warm cream (#F5ECD7) overall, with cells in turquoise (#1FBFB8), atomic orange (#E8601C), mustard (#E5A535), olive (#5E6B3A), coral pink (#E8837C)
- Text: Charcoal gray (#3D3D3D) on cream; white or cream on colored cells
- Accents: Starburst shapes in contrasting colors

**Visual Elements**:
- Starburst/atomic star shapes as decorative motifs and bullet markers
- Boomerang and kidney-bean shapes as dividers and containers
- Tapered legs supporting shapes — everything hovers lightly
- Flat color fills, NO gradients — each shape is a single solid color
- Thin charcoal outlines around shapes, slightly offset for a screen-print feel
- Subtle paper texture grain visible through everything
- Simplified stylized figures with small heads, pointy shoes, triangular torsos
- Diamond grid patterns as background texture accents
- Electron orbit ellipses connecting related items

**Typography**:
- Clean rounded sans-serif — friendly and modern, not stiff
- Mixed case for body, display weight for headlines
- Text at occasional jaunty 5-degree angles
- Color-coded labels matching their category shapes
- NO formal serif, NO heavy decorative type

**Anti-Patterns**:
- NOT realistic — this is flat stylized illustration, not vintage photography
- NOT corporate Memphis — MCM has specific warm retro colors and atomic motifs
- NOT Art Deco — no gold, no black backgrounds, no metallic sheen
- Must look like a page from a 1955 Golden Book or a Charley Harper print
