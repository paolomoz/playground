## Style Guidelines

### Matsumoto Style — Loose Expressive Urban Ink

Loose, scratchy black ink on rough paper — tangled power lines snagging across a narrow Tokyo alley, a kid with an oversized head perched on a rooftop, concrete walls covered in half-peeled posters and rain streaks. Every line vibrates with nervous energy, every ink splatter is left in on purpose, every perspective tilts and swoops. Raw, kinetic, deeply human.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Dense sumi black ink — varying densities from rich velvety black to thin scratchy gray
- Background: Rough off-white paper (#F0E6D0) with visible grain, like a well-thumbed manga page
- Grays: Concrete gray (#8B8B8B), asphalt gray (#6B6B6B), weathered wall gray (#A8A8A0)
- Accents: Washed-out sky blue (#A8C8E8), warm sunset orange (#E8915A), rust red (#C85A4A), weathered teal (#6B9B8A)
- Text: Black ink on paper, hand-lettered feel

**Visual Elements — MUST include:**
- **Loose, varying ink lines** — lines that wobble and breathe, thick where the brush presses, thin where it lifts, sometimes breaking into dry-brush texture. Never uniform, never mechanical
- **Dense crosshatching for shadows** — tight parallel pen lines layered at angles, visible as individual strokes
- **Ink splatters and drips left in** — accidental marks kept as texture, celebrated not cleaned up
- **Tangled power lines and utility wires** — thin ink lines crisscrossing the upper portions of compositions
- **Dense urban layering** — buildings stacked behind buildings, signs overlapping, pipes and AC units jutting out
- **Exaggerated character proportions** — oversized round heads on small wiry bodies, minimal facial features with maximum expression
- **Dynamic tilted perspectives** — compositions tilted off-axis, vertiginous bird's-eye views, extreme foreshortening
- **Watercolor washes bleeding past line boundaries** — color applied loosely, pooling and leaving dry spots
- **Visible paper texture** — rough drawing paper grain showing through
- **Hand-written text and signage** — wonky, part of the urban texture
- **NO clean digital lines, NO smooth gradients, NO airbrushed shading** — everything hand-drawn on real paper

**Typography:**
- Hand-lettered with brush pen feel — uneven baselines, variable stroke width
- Condensed angular letterforms with raw energy, like signage on a concrete wall
- Text integrated into the urban scene as shop signs, wall graffiti, street markers
- Black ink on paper, or white reversed out of dense black areas

**CRITICAL Anti-Patterns:**
- **NOT sumi-e** (no zen minimalism, no serene nature)
- **NOT clean manga** (no screen tones, no uniform lines, no sparkly eyes)
- **NOT storybook watercolor** (not soft or gentle — raw and gritty)
- **NOT architectural illustration** (buildings should be wonky, expressive, alive — not perfectly drawn)
- Must look like pages torn from a sketchbook carried through Tokyo backstreets — ink-stained, spontaneous, raw, full of nervous life

# CITY SURVIVAL GUIDE

A bento-grid infographic about thriving in a big city. 6 cells total — 1 hero + 5 tips. Rendered in loose expressive ink with urban Tokyo aesthetic.

## HERO CELL (2x1 wide, top):
Title: "CITY SURVIVAL GUIDE"
Visual: Dense cityscape viewed from a rooftop — tangled power lines in the foreground, buildings receding into hazy distance, a small figure with an oversized head sitting on the roof edge looking out. Rendered in loose black ink with warm sunset orange watercolor wash across the sky. The title hand-lettered in bold brushstrokes across the top. Ink splatters in the corners.

## CELL 1 — KNOW YOUR SHORTCUTS:
Headline: "KNOW YOUR SHORTCUTS"
Visual: Bird's-eye view looking down into a narrow alley between dense buildings — a tiny figure running through, power lines overhead, shop signs jutting out. Dense crosshatching on building walls. Ink only, no color.
Labels: "Back alleys beat main roads" / "Learn the city's veins"

## CELL 2 — EAT WHERE LOCALS EAT:
Headline: "EAT LOCAL"
Visual: A cramped ramen counter drawn in loose ink — steam rising as squiggly lines, bowls as quick circles, a cook with an oversized head behind the counter. Warm orange watercolor wash for the warm light inside. Dense ink work on the kitchen equipment.
Labels: "Follow the steam" / "Skip the tourist traps"

## CELL 3 — RIDE THE LAST TRAIN:
Headline: "LAST TRAIN"
Visual: A figure with a big round head slumped asleep on a train seat, loose ink lines, the window showing city lights as scattered dots. Blue-gray watercolor wash for the night mood. The train interior rendered in quick scratchy lines.
Labels: "Know the schedule" / "Or walk home"

## CELL 4 — FIND YOUR ROOFTOP:
Headline: "FIND YOUR ROOFTOP"
Visual: Looking up from street level at buildings converging toward a small patch of sky, tangled with wires. A tiny figure climbing a fire escape ladder. Dense ink crosshatching on the lower buildings, getting lighter and sketchier toward the sky.
Labels: "Everyone needs perspective" / "The city looks different from above"

## CELL 5 — EMBRACE THE RAIN:
Headline: "EMBRACE THE RAIN"
Visual: A figure walking with an umbrella on a wet street, reflections rendered as loose wavy ink lines on the ground. Rain as diagonal scratchy lines across the whole cell. Washed-out blue-gray watercolor wash. Dense ink on the buildings, lighter on the figure.
Labels: "Rain reveals the city's soul" / "Carry an umbrella always"

**IMPORTANT STYLE NOTES:**
- Every cell should look like it was drawn with a brush and pen on rough paper
- Ink splatters and drips scattered naturally throughout — not decorative, just left in from the drawing process
- Power lines/wires should appear in at least 3 cells as thin crossing lines
- Characters should have oversized round heads and minimal features
- Buildings should lean, sag, and breathe — never perfectly straight
- Watercolor washes should bleed past ink boundaries, be uneven, pool in corners
- Visible paper grain texture throughout
- Cell borders should look hand-drawn — slightly wobbly ruled lines, not perfect rectangles

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "CITY SURVIVAL GUIDE"
- Cell 1: "KNOW YOUR SHORTCUTS" / "Back alleys beat main roads"
- Cell 2: "EAT LOCAL" / "Follow the steam"
- Cell 3: "LAST TRAIN" / "Know the schedule"
- Cell 4: "FIND YOUR ROOFTOP" / "Everyone needs perspective"
- Cell 5: "EMBRACE THE RAIN" / "Rain reveals the city's soul"
