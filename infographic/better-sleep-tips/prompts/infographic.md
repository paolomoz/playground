## Layout Guidelines

### Bento Grid Layout

Modular grid layout with varied cell sizes, like a bento box.

**Structure:**
- Grid of rectangular cells
- Mixed cell sizes (1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 2x2)
- No strict symmetry required
- Hero cell for main point
- Supporting cells around it

**Visual Elements:**
- Clear cell boundaries
- Varied cell backgrounds
- Icons or illustrations per cell
- Consistent padding/margins
- Visual hierarchy through size

**Text Placement:**
- Main title at top
- Cell titles within each cell
- Brief content per cell
- Minimal text, maximum visual
- CTA or summary in prominent cell

## Style Guidelines

### Memphis Design Style (1980s Postmodern)

Loud, clashing, deliberately "bad taste" 1980s postmodern design — hot pink triangles colliding with acid yellow zigzags on a speckled terrazzo background, thick black outlines around everything, squiggly lines crawling across surfaces like rebellious graffiti. This is Ettore Sottsass's Carlton bookshelf, a Nathalie du Pasquier fabric print, a De Stijl grid having a wild party with a pack of highlighter markers. Maximalist, irreverent, and unapologetically fun.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Hot pink (#E84393), electric blue (#0984E3), acid yellow (#FFEAA7 bright) / banana yellow (#FDCB6E)
- Background: Bright white (#FFFFFF) with scattered confetti/terrazzo speckles
- Darks: True black (#000000) for thick outlines, bold stripes, and high-contrast pattern fills
- Accents: Teal green (#00CEC9), coral red (#FF6348), lavender purple (#A29BFE), mint green (#55EFC4)
- Text: Black on white or colored panels; white reversed out of black or dark panels; never gray — always maximum contrast

**Visual Elements — MUST include:**
- **Thick black outlines** around every shape — 4-6px stroke weight, confident and bold, like a coloring book drawn with a fat marker
- **Zigzag/chevron bands** running across panels — jagged lightning-bolt stripes in clashing colors
- **Squiggly lines** — loose, hand-drawn wavy lines meandering across surfaces
- **Terrazzo/confetti speckle** — small irregular dots, triangles, and dashes scattered randomly across backgrounds
- **Bold geometric shapes** — triangles, circles, semicircles as standalone visual elements, each a different saturated color
- **Clashing pattern fills** — each cell filled with a DIFFERENT pattern (dots, stripes, crosshatch, zigzags). Patterns intentionally mismatched between cells
- **Diagonal stripe bands** in two contrasting colors used as borders and dividers
- **NO gradients, NO shadows, NO 3D effects** — everything flat, graphic, boldly outlined
- **NO subtle anything** — every choice should feel deliberately loud

**Typography:**
- Heavy bold sans-serif — chunky, confident, taking up space
- All-caps for titles and labels
- Key words in contrasting highlight colors
- Slight rotation (2-5 degrees) on some headlines for playful energy
- Black text with thick outlines, or white text reversed out of colored panels

**CRITICAL Anti-Patterns:**
- **NOT corporate Memphis** (the Silicon Valley flat illustration style with muted tones and blobby figures)
- **NOT a clean modern infographic** that happens to use bright colors — the zigzags, squiggles, terrazzo, and clashing patterns ARE the point
- **NOT vaporwave/synthwave** — no gradients, no grid horizons
- Must look like an Ettore Sottsass furniture showroom exploded onto paper — loud, clashing, pattern-on-pattern, thick outlines, confetti everywhere

Generate the infographic based on the content below:

# 5 TIPS FOR BETTER SLEEP

## HERO CELL (largest cell, 2x1 wide at top):
Title: "5 TIPS FOR BETTER SLEEP"
Subtitle: "Simple habits for restful nights"
Visual: Bold Memphis geometric shapes — a crescent moon and stars built from triangles and circles, hot pink and acid yellow on electric blue background with terrazzo confetti. Thick black outlines on everything.

## CELL 1 — CONSISTENT SCHEDULE:
Headline: "KEEP A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE"
Visual: Geometric alarm clock with thick black outlines — clock face as a bold circle, hands as triangles, all on a hot pink background with zigzag border
Labels: "Same time daily" / "Even weekends"
Key detail: Regulates internal clock

## CELL 2 — LIMIT SCREEN TIME:
Headline: "LIMIT SCREEN TIME"
Visual: Phone/tablet with a bold X through it — device as a rectangle, X as thick diagonal lines, on acid yellow background with polka dot pattern
Labels: "60 min before bed" / "Blue light blocks melatonin"

## CELL 3 — COOL & DARK ROOM:
Headline: "COOL & DARK ROOM"
Visual: Thermometer as a bold geometric shape showing ideal range, surrounded by semicircles and zigzag patterns, on electric blue background with diagonal stripe border
Labels: "65-68°F / 18-20°C" / "Blackout curtains"

## CELL 4 — WATCH WHAT YOU CONSUME:
Headline: "WATCH WHAT YOU CONSUME"
Visual: Coffee cup and plate as bold geometric shapes with prohibition circles, on teal green background with squiggly line pattern
Labels: "No caffeine after 2 PM" / "No heavy meals 3hrs before" / "Alcohol disrupts REM"

## CELL 5 — MOVE YOUR BODY:
Headline: "MOVE YOUR BODY"
Visual: Running figure built from stacked geometric shapes (circle head, triangle torso, rectangle legs) in clashing colors, on coral background with chevron pattern
Labels: "30 min daily" / "Finish 3+ hrs before bed"

**IMPORTANT**: Each cell MUST have a DIFFERENT background color AND a DIFFERENT pattern fill. The cells should clash with each other deliberately — that's the Memphis aesthetic. Every cell outlined in thick black. Terrazzo confetti specks scattered in negative spaces.

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "5 TIPS FOR BETTER SLEEP"
- Cell 1: "KEEP A CONSISTENT SCHEDULE" / "Same time daily" / "Even weekends"
- Cell 2: "LIMIT SCREEN TIME" / "60 min before bed" / "Blue light blocks melatonin"
- Cell 3: "COOL & DARK ROOM" / "65-68°F / 18-20°C" / "Blackout curtains"
- Cell 4: "WATCH WHAT YOU CONSUME" / "No caffeine after 2 PM" / "No heavy meals 3hrs before" / "Alcohol disrupts REM"
- Cell 5: "MOVE YOUR BODY" / "30 min daily" / "Finish 3+ hrs before bed"
