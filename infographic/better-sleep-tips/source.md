# 5 Tips for Better Sleep

1. **Keep a Consistent Schedule** — Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This regulates your body's internal clock.

2. **Limit Screen Time** — Avoid phones, tablets, and computers for at least 60 minutes before bed. Blue light suppresses melatonin production.

3. **Create a Cool, Dark Environment** — Keep your bedroom at 65-68°F (18-20°C). Use blackout curtains and remove light sources.

4. **Watch What You Consume** — Avoid caffeine after 2 PM and heavy meals within 3 hours of bedtime. Alcohol disrupts REM sleep.

5. **Move Your Body** — Get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, but finish workouts 3+ hours before sleep.
