Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression (horizontal flow, process variant)
- **Style**: mid-century modern — clean and professional
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- **CLEAN FLAT ILLUSTRATION**: Flat color fills, no gradients, no photorealism — but restrained and professional, not whimsical
- **MINIMAL DECORATION**: No scattered starbursts, atoms, or boomerangs in the background. The background is clean warm cream with nothing floating in it. All visual interest comes from the content itself, not filler decorations.
- Clear left-to-right flow along a simple connecting line or gentle curve
- Each step has a clean flat illustration and minimal text
- Generous whitespace — the design breathes

## Layout Guidelines

Horizontal linear progression — 5 steps flowing left to right:
- A simple, clean connecting line or gentle curve links all 5 steps (not a wild boomerang — a restrained path)
- Each step marked by a clean numbered circle or simple geometric shape
- Below each marker: a flat illustration and a short label
- Arrows or subtle directional cues guide the eye
- Even, consistent spacing between all steps

## Style Guidelines

Mid-century modern palette and flat illustration — but the PROFESSIONAL side of the movement. Think Eames office, not diner placemat.

**Color Palette**:
- Background: Clean warm cream (#F5ECD7) — completely empty, no decorative filler
- Connector path: Turquoise (#1FBFB8) — a single clean line or gentle curve
- Step markers: Rotating through turquoise (#1FBFB8), atomic orange (#E8601C), mustard (#E5A535), coral (#E8837C), olive (#5E6B3A)
- Text: Charcoal gray (#3D3D3D)

**Visual Elements**:
- Clean numbered circles or rounded squares as step markers
- Flat illustrated objects at each step — simple, clear, professional
- Thin charcoal outlines around illustrations
- Subtle paper texture grain on cream background
- **NO scattered starbursts in background**
- **NO floating boomerangs or atomic symbols**
- **NO decorative filler between steps** — just clean space
- The only decoration is the content itself

**Typography**:
- Clean sans-serif, professional and readable
- Step numbers clear and bold
- Labels in sentence case — clean, not bouncy or tilted
- Title prominent but restrained
