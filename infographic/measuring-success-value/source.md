# Measuring Success

## The 6+1 Value Framework
Six types of value that build on each other:
1. **Perceived Value** — customer sees potential before buying
2. **Contractual Value** — Adobe revenue from signed deals
3. **Top-line Value** — actual customer business outcome
4. **GA Usage** — product usage after general availability
5. **Bottom-line Value** — cost savings for the customer
6. **Post-GA Usage** — continued and expanded usage
7. **(+1)** — additional value dimension

## Team Metrics: Usage Over Revenue
- No direct dollar revenue targets for the team
- Success measured by **usage**: adoption, engagement, production deployment
- "We don't talk about sales, we talk about usage." — Paolo Mottadelli

## Key KPIs
- Pages imported with Experience Catalyst
- Deals instrumented with Digital Insights
- Deals reporting impact from Digital Insights
- Customer production deployments

## Product-Level Economics
- P42 agents charged per usage based on actual value delivered
- Example: pay per page imported, not per token burned
- Dollar value communicated to customers at the product level, not the team level
