Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: hub-spoke (central concept radiating outward)
- **Style**: matsumoto (Taiyo Matsumoto-inspired loose expressive ink, urban)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (square)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

Central hub with 6 spokes radiating outward to nodes. The hub is the core concept, spokes are connections, outer nodes are components.

## Style Guidelines

### Matsumoto Style — Loose Expressive Urban Ink

Loose, scratchy black ink on rough off-white paper. Dense urban environments, exaggerated characters, tangled wires. Watercolor washes for accent color. Crosshatching for shadows. Everything hand-drawn on rough paper. Buildings lean, perspectives tilt.

**MUST include:** Loose varying ink lines, crosshatching, ink splatters, tangled wires, dense urban detail, exaggerated characters with oversized heads, watercolor washes, visible paper texture, hand-lettered text.

**NOT:** Clean manga, sumi-e, storybook watercolor, or polished illustration.

# WHAT MAKES A GREAT CITY

A hub-spoke diagram with "GREAT CITY" at the center and 6 qualities radiating outward. The entire composition should look like a bird's-eye view of a city with the hub as a central plaza and spokes as streets radiating outward to different neighborhoods.

## TITLE (top, hand-lettered):
"WHAT MAKES A GREAT CITY"
Bold brushy hand-lettered title with ink splatters around it.

## CENTER HUB:
"GREAT CITY" — Rendered as a bird's-eye view of a city intersection/plaza drawn in dense ink crosshatching, viewed from directly above. Buildings surround the center. The text hand-lettered large in the center.

## SPOKE 1 (top) — WALKABILITY:
Visual: A narrow street scene with a small figure walking between dense buildings, power lines overhead. Loose ink, minimal crosshatching. Light and airy.
Label: "WALKABILITY"
Detail: "Streets made for people"
Accent: Weathered teal watercolor wash

## SPOKE 2 (top-right) — FOOD CULTURE:
Visual: A tiny ramen counter scene — steam, bowls, a cook. Dense warm ink work.
Label: "FOOD CULTURE"
Detail: "Every alley hides a gem"
Accent: Warm orange watercolor wash

## SPOKE 3 (bottom-right) — PUBLIC TRANSIT:
Visual: A train carriage interior with sleeping passengers (oversized heads), rendered in quick scratchy lines.
Label: "PUBLIC TRANSIT"
Detail: "Moving millions daily"
Accent: Blue-gray watercolor wash

## SPOKE 4 (bottom) — GREEN SPACES:
Visual: A small park squeezed between buildings — a single tree with loose scribbly foliage, a bench, a figure reading.
Label: "GREEN SPACES"
Detail: "Breathing room in concrete"
Accent: Weathered teal/green wash

## SPOKE 5 (bottom-left) — NIGHT LIFE:
Visual: A narrow bar street at night — neon signs rendered as quick brush marks, tiny figures, dense ink shadows.
Label: "NIGHT LIFE"
Detail: "The city after dark"
Accent: Dusty purple and rust red wash

## SPOKE 6 (top-left) — CHARACTER:
Visual: An old building facade with peeling posters, a rusty mailbox, tangled wires — the texture of a place with history.
Label: "CHARACTER"
Detail: "Imperfection is beauty"
Accent: Warm orange wash on the aged walls

**SPOKE CONNECTIONS:** Spokes should be rendered as streets/alleys radiating from the central plaza, drawn in loose ink. Power lines can follow some spoke paths. Each outer node is a small scene rendered as a vignette.

**Each spoke node should have a different watercolor accent color.** The center hub should be the densest ink work. Outer nodes should be lighter and sketchier.

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "WHAT MAKES A GREAT CITY"
- Center: "GREAT CITY"
- Spokes: "WALKABILITY" / "FOOD CULTURE" / "PUBLIC TRANSIT" / "GREEN SPACES" / "NIGHT LIFE" / "CHARACTER"
