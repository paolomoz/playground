Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression (horizontal timeline)
- **Style**: matsumoto (Taiyo Matsumoto-inspired loose expressive ink, urban)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

Sequential horizontal flow from left to right, showing a timeline through a single day. Nodes at key time points connected by a winding path. Clear progression from dawn to midnight.

## Style Guidelines

### Matsumoto Style — Loose Expressive Urban Ink

Loose, scratchy black ink on rough off-white paper. Tangled power lines, dense urban environments, exaggerated character proportions (big heads, small bodies). Watercolor washes for color — warm orange for morning/sunset, blue-gray for night. Ink splatters left in. Crosshatching for shadows. Everything hand-drawn, nothing clean or digital. Buildings lean and breathe. Perspectives tilt.

**Palette:** Black ink dominant. Off-white paper (#F0E6D0). Accents: warm orange (#E8915A), sky blue (#A8C8E8), dusty purple (#9B8BA8), rust red (#C85A4A), concrete grays.

**MUST include:** Loose varying ink lines, crosshatching, ink splatters, tangled power lines, dense urban layering, exaggerated characters with oversized heads, watercolor washes bleeding past boundaries, visible paper texture, hand-lettered text.

**NOT:** Clean manga, sumi-e, storybook watercolor, or polished illustration. Must look like a sketchbook carried through Tokyo backstreets.

# A DAY IN THE CITY

A horizontal timeline from left to right showing 5 moments through a day in a city. The entire infographic should feel like one continuous panoramic ink drawing of a cityscape, with the timeline embedded in the urban landscape itself — the path is the street, the nodes are locations.

## TITLE (top, hand-lettered):
"A DAY IN THE CITY"
Brushy hand-lettered title across the top, with thin power lines running behind the text.

## 6:00 AM — DAWN:
Scene: A figure with an oversized head stretching on a rooftop at dawn, city silhouette in the background. Warm orange watercolor wash for the sky bleeding into the buildings. Loose ink lines, buildings barely sketched.
Label: "DAWN" / "The city wakes"
Time marker: "6 AM" hand-drawn in circle

## 9:00 AM — COMMUTE:
Scene: Dense train station platform, packed with small figures with round heads, all crammed together. Dense crosshatching on the station ceiling and pillars. Ink only, no color — the chaos of morning rush rendered in pure black and white.
Label: "COMMUTE" / "Shoulder to shoulder"
Time marker: "9 AM"

## 1:00 PM — LUNCH:
Scene: A narrow alley with a tiny ramen shop, steam rising from the kitchen as squiggly lines, a figure sitting at the counter. Warm orange/yellow watercolor wash for the cozy interior glow against the gray alley walls.
Label: "LUNCH" / "Hidden gems in back alleys"
Time marker: "1 PM"

## 6:00 PM — SUNSET:
Scene: Looking up from street level at buildings converging toward the sky, tangled power lines silhouetted against a vivid sunset. Strong warm orange and dusty purple watercolor wash. The buildings rendered as dark ink silhouettes.
Label: "SUNSET" / "The golden hour"
Time marker: "6 PM"

## 11:00 PM — MIDNIGHT:
Scene: A lone figure walking down a rain-slicked street at night, reflections in the puddles rendered as loose wavy ink lines. Blue-gray and indigo watercolor wash. Street lights as scattered bright spots. Dense ink on the buildings, the figure small and solitary.
Label: "MIDNIGHT" / "The city never sleeps"
Time marker: "11 PM"

**CONNECTING PATH:** The scenes should be connected by a street/alley path running left to right across the bottom of the composition, drawn as a loose ink line. Power lines should run continuously across the top, connecting all scenes.

**LIGHT PROGRESSION:** The watercolor washes should shift from warm orange (dawn) → no color/ink only (commute) → warm yellow (lunch) → orange+purple (sunset) → blue-gray (midnight), creating a natural day-to-night color arc across the panorama.

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "A DAY IN THE CITY"
- Nodes: "DAWN" / "COMMUTE" / "LUNCH" / "SUNSET" / "MIDNIGHT"
