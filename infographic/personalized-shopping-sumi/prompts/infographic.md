Create an expressive infographic in the style of Japanese sumi-e ink wash painting. This should look like a piece of traditional ink art that communicates information through the beauty of brush and emptiness — NOT a grayscale corporate diagram.

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Artistic infographic
- **Layout**: Binary comparison (split composition)
- **Style**: Sumi-e ink wash
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## CRITICAL STYLE DIRECTION

Study the reference images carefully. This infographic must have:
- Bold black sumi ink brush strokes with visible bristle texture — each stroke painted once, never reworked
- Ink wash gradients from velvety jet black to the palest grey ghost, with misty atmospheric dissolving edges
- Vast empty white space ("ma") — the rice paper breathes, at least 50% of the surface should be untouched white
- An off-white, slightly warm paper ground — never bright sterile white
- A single bold vermillion red sun disc as the key color accent, placed asymmetrically
- Small red seal stamps (hanko) in corners
- Cherry blossom branches with gnarled black bark and soft pink petals reaching across the composition
- Misty mountain silhouettes layered in diminishing ink concentration — dark foreground, pale grey distance
- Figures rendered as minimal ink silhouettes — a person is just a robed shape, a few confident strokes
- Vertical brush calligraphy integrated into the composition as visual rhythm
- Ink splatter and controlled accidents adding organic texture

## Layout: Split Composition — Sumi-e Style

The canvas is divided not by a hard line but by EMPTY SPACE — a river of white paper flowing between two worlds. The left and right scenes are separated by the void itself.

**LEFT HALF — warm, alive, human (Sarah's world):**
A woman figure rendered as a minimal ink silhouette — a few confident brush strokes suggesting a robed figure holding something (her phone). Around her, circular ink wash clouds (like soft grey mist circles) contain her thoughts: a small family gathered around a table (tiny ink silhouettes), bamboo-like shapes suggesting a blender, small child figures as simple two-stroke forms. A cherry blossom branch arches over this scene, pink petals drifting down — warmth, life, family.

The ink here is WARM — slightly softer washes, more organic curves, the brush strokes flowing and gentle. Soft pink cherry blossom petals provide the only color on this side.

Key text brushed as calligraphy: "she's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup"

Labels as delicate brush writing: "sarah's world", "family dinner", "smoothies", "soup", "two kids"

**RIGHT HALF — cold, rigid, mechanical (the generic page):**
A dense grid of small black ink rectangles — like a wall of brushed characters, but uniform and repetitive. Rigid horizontal lines. No curves, no organic forms, no cherry blossoms. The ink is harsh, the strokes mechanical and uniform — this is sumi-e stripped of its soul, turned into a specification table. The brushwork here is deliberately stiff and lifeless compared to the left side.

Grey ink washes here are cold and flat — no atmospheric beauty, just oppressive grey fog.

Key text: "a comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode", "she gets the same product page as everyone else"

Labels: "the generic page", "40 rows", "wall of specifications", "same for everyone"

**CENTER — the empty river:**
The space between the two worlds is pure white paper — the most powerful element. A single gnarled branch might reach from left toward right but stops short, unable to bridge the gap. This emptiness IS the disconnect.

Small text near the gap: "the disconnect"

## Title and Question

**Top**: "the problem" — bold brush calligraphy, confident thick strokes
**Bottom spanning full width**: "what if the website already knew?" — brushed in vermillion red ink, the ONLY use of the red sun color for text, making it impossible to ignore against the monochrome field

## A vermillion red sun disc

Place a bold red sun disc in the upper portion of the composition — asymmetric, slightly bleeding at edges. This is the signature sumi-e element and the emotional anchor of the piece.

## What This Must NOT Be

- NOT a watercolor painting — this is INK, bold brush strokes, not soft wet pigment
- NOT a greyscale digital illustration — visible brush texture and rice paper quality are essential
- NOT cluttered — the empty white space is the most important element
- NOT a corporate split-screen infographic with icons — this is traditional ink art that tells a story
- This must look like it was painted with a loaded brush on rice paper, not generated as a grayscale filter
