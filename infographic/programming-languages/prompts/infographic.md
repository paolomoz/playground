Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: tree-branching (taxonomy/classification tree)
- **Style**: memphis (1980s Memphis Group postmodern design)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

### Tree Branching Layout

Hierarchical structure branching from root to leaves.

**Structure:**
- Root concept at top center
- Two main branches splitting downward
- Each branch has 3 leaf nodes
- Clear parent-child connecting lines (use squiggly lines — Memphis style)
- Color coding by branch

**Text Placement:**
- Title at very top
- Root concept prominently labeled
- Branch and leaf labels at each node
- Brief descriptions at key nodes

## Style Guidelines

### Memphis Design Style (1980s Postmodern)

Loud, clashing 1980s postmodern design. Hot pink triangles, acid yellow zigzags, terrazzo backgrounds, thick black outlines, squiggly lines. Maximalist and irreverent.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Hot pink (#E84393), electric blue (#0984E3), acid yellow (#FDCB6E)
- Background: White with terrazzo confetti speckles
- Darks: True black for thick outlines
- Accents: Teal green (#00CEC9), coral red (#FF6348), lavender purple (#A29BFE), mint green (#55EFC4)

**MUST include:**
- **Thick black outlines** around every node and shape (4-6px)
- **Each branch a DIFFERENT clashing color** — one branch hot pink family, other electric blue family
- **Pattern fills** — each node has a different pattern (dots, stripes, zigzags, crosshatch)
- **Zigzag connecting lines** instead of straight branches
- **Terrazzo confetti** scattered across the white background
- **Bold geometric shapes** for nodes — root as large circle, branches as triangles, leaves as rectangles/semicircles
- **Squiggly decorative lines** around the composition
- Heavy bold sans-serif all-caps typography
- **NO gradients, NO shadows** — flat and outlined

**Anti-Patterns:**
- NOT corporate Memphis — must be loud, clashing, pattern-heavy
- NOT a clean org chart — must feel like Memphis furniture stacked into a tree

Generate the infographic based on the content below:

# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

A tree branching from "Programming Languages" root into two major branches.

## TITLE (top):
"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"
Bold Memphis typography, slightly rotated, on zigzag-striped banner.

## ROOT NODE (center top):
"PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES" — Large bold circle, electric blue with thick black outline, terrazzo speckle inside

## BRANCH 1 — FRONTEND (left branch):
Branch label: "FRONTEND"
Branch color: Hot pink family
Node shape: Triangle pointing down

### Leaf 1.1:
Name: "JAVASCRIPT"
Detail: "The web's language"
Node: Hot pink rectangle with polka dot fill

### Leaf 1.2:
Name: "TYPESCRIPT"
Detail: "JS with types"
Node: Coral rectangle with diagonal stripe fill

### Leaf 1.3:
Name: "CSS"
Detail: "Style & layout"
Node: Lavender rectangle with crosshatch fill

## BRANCH 2 — BACKEND (right branch):
Branch label: "BACKEND"
Branch color: Electric blue family
Node shape: Triangle pointing down

### Leaf 2.1:
Name: "PYTHON"
Detail: "AI & data science"
Node: Electric blue rectangle with zigzag fill

### Leaf 2.2:
Name: "GO"
Detail: "Fast & concurrent"
Node: Teal rectangle with chevron fill

### Leaf 2.3:
Name: "RUST"
Detail: "Safe & blazing fast"
Node: Mint green rectangle with squiggly fill

**Each node must have a DIFFERENT pattern fill and DIFFERENT accent color. Connecting lines should be thick, squiggly, and in contrasting colors.**

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES"
- Branch 1: "FRONTEND" → "JAVASCRIPT" / "TYPESCRIPT" / "CSS"
- Branch 2: "BACKEND" → "PYTHON" / "GO" / "RUST"
