- Accent 1: #E05880 rose red (for pills, badges, buttons)
- Accent 2: #F0A830 warm gold (for highlights, stars, emphasis)
- Stars: Pink-gold iridescent holographic 3D star shapes
- Cards: White #FFFFFF with 20-24px rounded corners and soft shadows, floating at slight angles
- Text: #1A1A2E headlines, #4A4A6A body text
