# The Problem: Generic vs. Personalized Shopping

## Overview

A parent searching for a blender gets the same impersonal product page as everyone else — dense specs, 40-row comparison tables — while her real family context is completely ignored.

## Learning Objectives

The viewer will understand:
1. The disconnect between a customer's real-world context and generic product pages
2. How specification overload forces users to do translation work themselves
3. The implied opportunity: what if the website already knew?

## Section 1: Sarah's World (Left Side)

**Key Concept**: A real person with specific family needs searching for a product

**Content**:
- "a mother at her phone"
- "thought bubbles showing family dinner, kids, a blender"
- "She's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: geometric figure construction (Schlemmer-style)
- Subject: simplified geometric mother figure with phone, surrounded by thought-bubble circles containing: family dinner scene, two child figures, a blender silhouette
- Treatment: warm red and yellow tones, circular thought bubbles, human and organic

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "sarah's world"
- Labels: "family dinner", "smoothies", "soup", "two kids"

## Section 2: The Generic Page (Right Side)

**Key Concept**: An impersonal product page that ignores individual context

**Content**:
- "she gets the same product page as everyone else"
- "A wall of specifications"
- "A comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode"
- "None of that matters to the page she's looking at"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: geometric grid/table construction
- Subject: dense grid of small rectangles representing specification rows, tiny text blocks, uniform and cold
- Treatment: cool blue tones, rigid grid, mechanical repetition, overwhelming density

**Text Labels**:
- Headline: "the generic page"
- Labels: "40 rows", "wall of specifications", "same for everyone"

## Section 3: The Disconnect (Center/Divider)

**Key Concept**: The gap between human needs and generic interfaces

**Content**:
- "She has to do the work of figuring out which features matter for her life"
- "None of that matters to the page she's looking at"

**Visual Element**:
- Type: strong vertical divider
- Subject: bold black vertical line or geometric barrier separating the two worlds
- Treatment: heavy black rule, Bauhaus grid line, with a provocative question below

**Text Labels**:
- Divider label: "the disconnect"
- Bottom question: "what if the website already knew?"
