## Main Topic

Generic product pages force every customer to do the same work — decoding dense specification tables — regardless of their actual needs. The content contrasts a parent's real-world context (family, kids, meal preferences) against a one-size-fits-all product page.

## Learning Objectives

After viewing this infographic, the viewer should understand:
1. The disconnect between a customer's real context and generic product pages
2. The burden placed on users to translate specifications into personal relevance
3. The opportunity for personalized product experiences

## Target Audience

- **Knowledge Level**: Intermediate (product managers, UX designers, e-commerce professionals)
- **Context**: Understanding the case for personalized shopping experiences
- **Expectations**: A clear, compelling visualization of the problem

## Content Type Analysis

- **Data Structure**: Binary comparison — human context vs. generic interface
- **Key Relationships**: Sarah's family needs ↔ product page content (disconnected)
- **Visual Opportunities**: Split-screen contrast (warm human scene vs. cold data wall), thought bubbles vs. specification rows

## Key Data Points (Verbatim)

- "she gets the same product page as everyone else"
- "A wall of specifications"
- "A comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode"
- "She's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup"
- "None of that matters to the page she's looking at"
- "She has to do the work of figuring out which features matter for her life"
- "What if the website already knew?"

## Layout × Style Signals

- Content type: comparison → suggests binary-comparison, bridge
- Tone: empathetic, problem-statement → suggests bauhaus (clarity, function)
- Audience: product/UX professionals → suggests bauhaus (systematic, modern)
- Complexity: simple (4 main points) → suggests clean, uncluttered layout

## Design Instructions (from user input)

- Style: bauhaus (specified by user)
- No other constraints specified

## Recommended Combinations

1. **binary-comparison + bauhaus** (Recommended): The source explicitly describes a split screen. Bauhaus's side-by-side geometric columns with contrasting primary colors (warm red for human context, cool blue for generic page) map directly to the content.
2. **bridge + bauhaus**: Frames the gap between current state (generic pages) and desired state (personalization). Bauhaus geometric bridge structure with clear problem/solution sides.
3. **iceberg + bauhaus**: Surface = what the product page shows (specs). Below waterline = Sarah's real life context. Bauhaus geometric iceberg with layered depth.
