### Slide 1 — The Problem (0:00–0:30)

**Visual:** Split screen. Left: a mother at her phone, thought bubbles showing family dinner, kids, a blender. Right: a generic product page with a dense comparison table and tiny text.

**Voiceover:**
"When Sarah searches for a blender for her family, she gets the same product page as everyone else. A wall of specifications. A comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode. She's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup. None of that matters to the page she's looking at. She has to do the work of figuring out which features matter for her life.

What if the website already knew?"
