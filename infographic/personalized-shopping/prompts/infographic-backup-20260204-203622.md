Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: binary-comparison
- **Style**: bauhaus
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- If content involves sensitive or copyrighted figures, create stylistically similar alternatives
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content
- Bold geometric sans-serif typography (Universal/Bayer style)
- Lowercase preference following Bayer's universal alphabet
- Type as compositional element, not afterthought
- Heavy weight for titles, light weight for body
- Red or primary-color accent on key words
- No serif, no script, no decorative faces

## Layout Guidelines: Binary Comparison

- Vertical divider splitting image in half
- Left side: Sarah's world (warm, human, personal context)
- Right side: The generic page (cold, impersonal, specification overload)
- Mirrored layout for easy comparison
- Clear visual distinction between sides
- Strong vertical dividing line
- Contrasting colors per side
- Matching element positions for comparison
- Main title centered at top
- Side labels for each half
- Summary/question at bottom

## Style Guidelines: Bauhaus

Systematic geometric design with primary colors and functional clarity, inspired by the Bauhaus school (1919-1933).

**Color approach**:
- LEFT SIDE (Sarah's world): Warm palette — pure red and yellow, warm tones, suggesting human warmth, family, life
- RIGHT SIDE (Generic page): Cool palette — pure blue and grey, cold tones, suggesting mechanical impersonality
- DIVIDER: Heavy black vertical rule
- BACKGROUND: White / off-white
- Overall: Classic Bauhaus primary color triad (red, yellow, blue) with black and white

**Visual elements**:
- Pure geometric primitives: circle, triangle, square as foundational shapes
- Primary colors assigned to shapes (yellow=triangle, red=square, blue=circle per Kandinsky's theory)
- Strong horizontal and vertical grid structure
- Flat color fills with no gradients or textures
- Heavy black outlines and rules
- Asymmetric but rigorously balanced compositions
- Generous white space as structural element
- Sans-serif typography integrated into the composition
- No decorative ornament — every element serves a function
- Overlapping transparent planes to show relationships

**Figure style**: Simplified geometric figure constructions inspired by Oskar Schlemmer's Triadic Ballet — people rendered as arrangements of circles, triangles, and rectangles. NOT realistic, NOT cartoon — purely geometric.

Generate the infographic based on the content below:

## LEFT SIDE — "sarah's world"

A geometric Schlemmer-style mother figure holding a rectangular phone shape. Around her, circular thought bubbles contain:
- A family dinner scene (simple geometric table with figure shapes around it)
- Two small geometric child figures
- A blender silhouette (geometric triangular/rectangular construction)

Key text: "She's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup"

This side uses RED and YELLOW tones. Warm. Human. Circles and organic arrangements within the grid.

Labels: "sarah's world" (section header), "family dinner", "smoothies", "soup", "two kids"

## CENTER DIVIDER — "the disconnect"

A bold black vertical line separating the two worlds. This is the core tension of the infographic — two realities that don't communicate.

Label: "the disconnect"

## RIGHT SIDE — "the generic page"

A dense, rigid grid of small blue rectangles representing rows of a specification table. Tiny geometric text blocks. Uniform, repetitive, overwhelming. A cold wall of data that treats every customer identically.

Key text: "A comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode"
Key text: "she gets the same product page as everyone else"

This side uses BLUE and GREY tones. Cold. Mechanical. Squares and rigid grid patterns.

Labels: "the generic page" (section header), "40 rows", "wall of specifications", "same for everyone"

## TITLE (top center)

"the problem" — large, bold, geometric sans-serif, black

## BOTTOM (spanning full width)

"what if the website already knew?" — prominent question in red, centered, bold

---

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "the problem"
- Left header: "sarah's world"
- Right header: "the generic page"
- Left labels: "family dinner", "smoothies", "soup", "two kids"
- Right labels: "40 rows", "wall of specifications", "same for everyone"
- Center label: "the disconnect"
- Bottom question: "what if the website already knew?"
