Create an expressive, artistic infographic in the style of Kandinsky's abstract compositions and Bauhaus geometric art. This should look like a piece of fine art that happens to communicate information — NOT a flat corporate diagram.

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Artistic infographic
- **Layout**: Binary comparison (split composition)
- **Style**: Bauhaus / Kandinsky abstract expressionism
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## CRITICAL STYLE DIRECTION

Study the reference images carefully. This infographic must have:
- The sweeping diagonal energy and musical rhythm of Kandinsky's Composition VIII
- Large bold circles with luminous colored halos (pink glow, blue aura) floating in the composition
- Thin precise black lines shooting diagonally across the entire canvas, creating tension
- Overlapping translucent geometric planes where colors blend at intersections
- A warm cream/parchment background — NEVER sterile white
- Rich, saturated, BOLD color — deep ultramarine, cadmium yellow, saturated red, teal, purple, olive
- Checkerboard fragments and fine parallel line groups as textural accents
- Dramatic arcs and curves fighting against sharp angular lines
- People/faces built from bold overlapping geometric shapes — eyes as concentric colored rings, features as triangles and arcs (like a cubist-Bauhaus portrait)

This is GEOMETRIC ABSTRACTION AS FINE ART. Every shape should feel intentional, expressive, and alive — not clip-art.

## Layout: Split Composition

The canvas is divided by a dramatic vertical element — not a simple line, but a bold compositional feature (a sweeping black arc, or a tower of geometric forms).

**LEFT HALF — warm, alive, human:**
Dominated by warm colors (saturated red, cadmium yellow, rose pink, orange). A Bauhaus-geometric portrait of a mother — her face constructed from overlapping bold triangles, circles with colored halos, and curved arcs. Surrounding her: circular thought-bubble forms containing geometric icons (a table shape with small figures around it, a blender constructed from triangles and rectangles, small child-figures as simple geometric constructions). Sweeping curved lines connect these thought-circles to her figure, creating a constellation of family life. Fine diagonal lines create musical rhythm across this half.

Key text woven into the composition: "she's a parent with two kids — one loves smoothies, one hates vegetables but eats soup"

Labels integrated as bold geometric letterforms: "sarah's world", "family dinner", "smoothies", "soup", "two kids"

**RIGHT HALF — cold, mechanical, oppressive:**
Dominated by cool colors (deep ultramarine blue, grey, teal, black). A rigid grid of small rectangles in blue and grey tones — dense, repeating, overwhelming — representing the wall of specifications. This grid should feel suffocating and impersonal compared to the organic warmth of the left side. Thin precise parallel lines reinforce the mechanical rigidity. Checkerboard fragments add visual texture. The geometric forms here are angular, sharp, uniform — no circles, no halos, no warmth.

Key text: "a comparison table with 40 rows she has to decode", "she gets the same product page as everyone else"

Labels: "the generic page", "40 rows", "wall of specifications", "same for everyone"

**CENTER DIVIDER — the tension:**
A bold black vertical compositional element — dramatic, architectural. Label: "the disconnect"

## Title and Question

**Top**: "the problem" — large, bold geometric sans-serif, integrated as a compositional element
**Bottom spanning full width**: "what if the website already knew?" — in saturated red, bold, prominent, the emotional punch of the piece

## Typography

- Bold geometric sans-serif, lowercase
- Text integrated INTO the composition, not floating above it
- Key words in saturated primary colors
- Lettering can overlap geometric forms for artistic depth
- Type follows the energy of the composition — slight angles allowed

## What This Must NOT Be

- NOT a flat corporate infographic with icons and boxes
- NOT a sterile diagram with thin lines on white
- NOT clip-art geometric shapes
- NOT a simple split-screen with text blocks
- This must look like it belongs in a gallery next to Kandinsky's Composition VIII
