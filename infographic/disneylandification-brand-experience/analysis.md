## Main Topic
The concept of "Disneylandification" frames the distinction between generic discovery experiences and delightful brand-owned experiences, arguing that brand surfaces should feel like Disneyland—actionable, trust-building, and context-aware—not like a search bar.

## Learning Objectives
After viewing this infographic, the viewer should understand:
1. The fundamental split between "discovery" (generic, outside the brand) and "brand experience" (owned, delightful)
2. The three concrete pillars that make brand experience exceptional: actionable interactions, trust signals, and meaningful events
3. The pipeline architecture: capture events → build context → deliver personalised experience

## Target Audience
- **Knowledge Level**: Intermediate (product/strategy professionals)
- **Context**: Understanding a strategic product philosophy for brand experience design
- **Expectations**: Clear mental model of how to transform brand surfaces from generic to delightful

## Content Type Analysis
- **Data Structure**: Central concept ("Disneylandification") with three radiating pillars, plus an underlying pipeline pattern connecting events to experience
- **Key Relationships**: Discovery ↔ Brand Experience (contrast); Three pillars support the central concept; Events → Context → Experience (pipeline flow); Connections to internal team patterns (Meeting Pipeline, Feedback Pipeline, Sustainable Fun)
- **Visual Opportunities**: The Disneyland metaphor is highly visual (theme park vs search bar); the two worlds can be shown as contrasting zones; the pipeline is a clear flow diagram; the three pillars lend themselves to distinct visual treatments

## Key Data Points (Verbatim)
- "There are two worlds: discovery (outside the brand -- search, social, generic chat) and brand experience (inside the brand's owned surface)"
- "The unbranded chat experience is generic. The brand experience must delight."
- "Users entering the brand expect Disneyland, not a search bar."
- "More actionable -- the brand experience should feel like an app, not a brochure. Users do things, not just read things."
- "Trust signals -- find and surface the signals that actually change user behaviour. Not generic badges, but context-aware proof points that matter to this user at this moment."
- "Meaningful events -- track events related to the user that are useful to build context. Context is the raw material for exceptional experience. Without it, personalisation is guesswork."
- "capture events --> build context --> deliver personalised experience"
- "The pipeline pattern from Category 1 is also the product architecture."
- "'Disneylandification' is the product equivalent of '10X while having fun.'"
- "The research question is which events actually move the needle on experience quality -- and which are noise."
- Meaningful event candidates: "purchase history, content engagement patterns, support interactions, lifecycle stage, expressed preferences vs. revealed preferences"

## Layout × Style Signals
- Content type: central concept + radiating pillars → suggests hub-spoke
- Content type: two contrasting worlds → suggests bridge or binary-comparison
- Content type: pipeline flow (events → context → experience) → suggests circular-flow
- Tone: strategic but playful ("Disneyland" metaphor) → suggests bold-graphic or claymation
- Audience: product/strategy professionals → suggests corporate-memphis or bold-graphic
- Complexity: moderate (7 points) → suggests balanced layout density

## Design Instructions (from user input)
No explicit design instructions provided by user.

## Recommended Combinations
1. **hub-spoke + bold-graphic** (Recommended): The central "Disneylandification" concept with three pillars radiating outward maps perfectly to hub-spoke. Bold-graphic's high-energy, comic-style aesthetic matches the playful Disneyland metaphor while maintaining professional impact.
2. **bridge + corporate-memphis**: The "two worlds" framing (discovery → brand experience) maps directly to the bridge layout's problem-to-solution structure. Corporate-memphis keeps it clean and business-appropriate.
3. **iceberg + storybook-watercolor**: Surface = what users see (generic search bar); below waterline = the hidden architecture (meaningful events, trust signals, context pipeline). Watercolor adds the whimsical, dreamy quality that matches the Disneyland theme.
4. **hub-spoke + claymation**: Same hub-spoke structure but with playful 3D clay aesthetic—literally making the concepts feel tangible and "delightful," echoing the Disneyland philosophy.
5. **circular-flow + corporate-memphis**: Emphasizes the pipeline architecture (events → context → experience → more events) as the core message. Clean vector style for professional audiences.
