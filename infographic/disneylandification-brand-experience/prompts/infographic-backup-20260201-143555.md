## Content

Generate the infographic based on the following structured content:

### TITLE (Center Hub)
**"DISNEYLANDIFICATION" OF THE BRAND EXPERIENCE**

The center hub should be large and dramatic, featuring the word "DISNEYLANDIFICATION" in bold comic-style lettering. Include a visual metaphor: a magical castle/theme park entrance icon to represent the Disneyland concept. Below or around it: "Users expect Disneyland, not a search bar"

### SPOKE 1 (Top): TWO WORLDS
Contrasting the two zones:
- Left side of node: "DISCOVERY" — generic, grey, dull (search, social, generic chat)
- Right side of node: "BRAND EXPERIENCE" — vibrant, magical, delightful (owned surface)
- Visual: split illustration showing grey search bar vs colorful theme park entrance
- Key text: "The unbranded experience is generic. The brand experience must delight."

### SPOKE 2 (Upper Right): MORE ACTIONABLE
- "App, not brochure"
- "Users do things, not just read things"
- Visual: interactive buttons, sliders, action elements (app-like) vs static page
- Bold emphasis on the word "ACTIONABLE"

### SPOKE 3 (Lower Right): TRUST SIGNALS
- "Context-aware proof points"
- "Not generic badges, but signals that matter to THIS user at THIS moment"
- Visual: a glowing personalised trust badge pointing to a specific user
- Bold emphasis on "THIS USER, THIS MOMENT"

### SPOKE 4 (Lower Left): MEANINGFUL EVENTS
- "Context is the raw material for exceptional experience"
- "Without it, personalisation is guesswork"
- Event types as small labels: Purchase history, Engagement patterns, Support interactions, Lifecycle stage, Expressed vs. revealed preferences
- Visual: stream of signal icons flowing into a context container

### SPOKE 5 (Upper Left): THE PIPELINE
- Three-step flow: CAPTURE EVENTS → BUILD CONTEXT → DELIVER EXPERIENCE
- "The product equivalent of '10X while having fun'"
- Visual: pipeline/flow arrows showing the three stages
- This connects the architecture back to the central concept
