- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

### hub-spoke Layout

Central concept with radiating connections to related items.

**Structure:**
- Central hub: The main concept "DISNEYLANDIFICATION" — prominent, large, eye-catching
- Spokes radiating outward to 5 nodes
- Even distribution around the hub
- Clear spoke lines connecting hub to nodes

**Visual Elements:**
- Prominent central hub (largest element)
- Clear spoke lines with directional feel
- Consistent node styling for each spoke item
- Icons representing each spoke item
- Optional grouping colors for related nodes

**Text Placement:**
- Title at top of infographic
- Core concept in center hub
- Spoke item labels at nodes
- Brief descriptions near nodes

## Style Guidelines

### ukiyo-e Style

Japanese woodblock print aesthetic (浮世絵) from the Edo period — bold outlines, flat color areas, layered compositions.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Indigo blue (ai-iro), vermillion red (shu), Prussian blue (bero-ai)
- Background: Warm cream (unprinted paper white), bokashi gradient skies
- Accents: Safflower pink (beni), yellow ochre (odo), verdigris green (rokusho), sumi black
- Use the "Dramatic" combination: Prussian blue + vermillion + black + white

**Visual Elements:**
- Bold, confident black outlines (sumi ink) with varying line weights
- Flat color areas with no gradients within shapes
- Colors appear layered, as if printed sequentially
- Subtle color bleeding at edges (bokashi effect for skies and water)
- Visible wood grain texture suggestion
- Paper texture undertone, matte non-glossy appearance
- Traditional cloud patterns (kumo) as section separators between spokes
- Stylized wave patterns around the central hub
- No photorealistic rendering, no soft gradients within shapes, no 3D perspective

**Compositional Patterns:**

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stacking with clouds separating layers | Mountain landscapes |
| Flow/process | Diagonal movement, water/path motifs | River scenes, Tokaido road |
| Connections | Bridges, boats between islands | Harbor scenes |
| Cycles | Circular wave patterns, seasonal motifs | Great Wave, cherry blossoms |
| Comparison | Side-by-side panels (diptych style) | Bijin-ga portraits |
| Categories | Distinct floating islands or platforms | Floating world scenes |

**Visual Metaphor Mappings (apply to spoke nodes):**
- The central hub (Disneylandification) → a grand castle or palace, the focal point
- Two Worlds (discovery vs brand experience) → a bridge connecting two islands
- More Actionable → craftsmen actively working, tools in hand
- Trust Signals → guardian komainu statues or a samurai standing watch
- Meaningful Events → flowing scrolls carried by cranes
- The Pipeline → a river flowing through three stages

**Typography:**
- Brush calligraphy style for the main title
- Clean, readable labels with ink-brush character
- Text integrated as banners, cartouches, or scroll elements
- Consistent with woodblock printing aesthetic

## Content

Generate the infographic based on the following structured content:

### TITLE (Top Banner)
**"DISNEYLANDIFICATION" OF THE BRAND EXPERIENCE**
Rendered as a horizontal banner scroll across the top, brush calligraphy style.

### CENTER HUB: The Castle
A grand Japanese castle (inspired by Edo-period architecture) at the center, representing "DISNEYLANDIFICATION." Surrounded by stylized waves and clouds. Below the castle: "Users expect Disneyland, not a search bar" on a scroll banner.

### SPOKE 1 (Top): TWO WORLDS — The Bridge
A bridge connecting two contrasting islands:
- Left island: grey, barren, with a plain torii gate — "DISCOVERY" (search, social, generic chat)
- Right island: vibrant, colorful, with a grand decorated gate — "BRAND EXPERIENCE" (owned surface)
- Scroll text: "The unbranded experience is generic. The brand experience must delight."

### SPOKE 2 (Upper Right): MORE ACTIONABLE — The Workshop
Active craftsmen at work — hammering, painting, building:
- Represents "App, not brochure"
- Workers doing things, not reading scrolls passively
- Banner text: "Users do things, not just read things"

### SPOKE 3 (Lower Right): TRUST SIGNALS — The Guardian
A komainu guardian statue or samurai standing at a gate, inspecting each visitor individually:
- Represents context-aware, personalised trust
- Not a generic barrier, but one that recognizes THIS person
- Scroll text: "Proof points for THIS user at THIS moment"

### SPOKE 4 (Lower Left): MEANINGFUL EVENTS — The Crane Messengers
Cranes flying in formation, each carrying a different scroll:
- Scrolls labeled: Purchase history, Engagement patterns, Support interactions, Lifecycle stage, Preferences
- All scrolls flowing toward a central collection vessel labeled "CONTEXT"
- Banner text: "Context is the raw material — Without it, personalisation is guesswork"

### SPOKE 5 (Upper Left): THE PIPELINE — The River
A river flowing through three distinct stages/waterfalls:
- Stage 1: "CAPTURE EVENTS" — water gathering from many small streams
- Stage 2: "BUILD CONTEXT" — water pooling in a processing basin
- Stage 3: "DELIVER EXPERIENCE" — water flowing out as a powerful, directed stream
- Scroll text: "The product equivalent of '10X while having fun'"
