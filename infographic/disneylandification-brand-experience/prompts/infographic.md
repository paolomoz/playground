## Layout Guidelines

### hub-spoke Layout

Central concept with radiating connections to related items.

**Structure:**
- Central hub: The main concept "DISNEYLANDIFICATION" — prominent, large, eye-catching
- Spokes radiating outward to 5 nodes
- Even distribution around the hub
- Clear spoke lines connecting hub to nodes — rendered as flowing organic vines

**Visual Elements:**
- Prominent central hub (largest element)
- Spoke lines as sinuous, flowing tendrils radiating from center
- Consistent node styling for each spoke item
- Icons representing each spoke item as Art Nouveau organic forms
- Grouping through color from the palette

**Text Placement:**
- Title at top of infographic
- Core concept in center hub
- Spoke item labels at nodes
- Brief descriptions near nodes

## Style Guidelines

### art-nouveau Style

Flowing organic lines, natural forms, and elegant ornamentation inspired by the Art Nouveau movement (1890-1910).

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Sage green, dusty rose, peacock blue (deep teal-blue), burgundy
- Background: Ivory/cream warm white
- Accents: Gold/bronze metallic, copper
- Use the "Rich" combination: Peacock blue + burgundy + gold + cream

**Visual Elements:**
- Sinuous, flowing "whiplash" curves inspired by natural forms
- Asymmetrical but balanced compositions
- Lines that flow into and become forms
- Organic shapes derived from plants, flowers, insects — stylized rather than realistic
- Decorative border framing the entire infographic — ornate, organic, integral to the design
- Negative space as active design element
- Smooth gradients suggesting depth within organic forms
- Gold/bronze metallic accents on titles and key elements
- Stained glass luminosity effect on focal areas
- Intertwining vines connecting the hub to spokes

**Visual Metaphor Mappings (apply to spoke nodes):**
- The central hub (Disneylandification) → a grand blooming flower or radiant sunburst at center, gold-accented
- Two Worlds (discovery vs brand experience) → mirrored organic forms: a bare winter branch vs a lush blooming vine
- More Actionable → unfurling fern or butterfly emerging from cocoon (transformation from passive to active)
- Trust Signals → a protective shell of petals opening to reveal a glowing center, personalized
- Meaningful Events → seeds and pollen flowing along vine tendrils into a collecting flower
- The Pipeline → a flowing stream/ribbon through three blooming stages

**Compositional approach:**
- Central radiant bloom or ornamental medallion as hub
- Five flowing vine/tendril spokes radiating outward, each ending in a distinct scene
- Ornate decorative border framing the entire composition (Mucha poster style)
- Gold leaf accents on titles and connecting lines
- Each spoke node enclosed in its own organic frame (leaf shape, petal shape, etc.)

**Typography:**
- Elegant flowing letterforms integrated with organic curves
- Gold or metallic title treatment for main title
- Text within decorative banner ribbons or organic cartouches
- Ornamental drop caps
- Art Nouveau display style — no modern sans-serif

## Content

Generate the infographic based on the following structured content:

### TITLE (Top Banner)
**"DISNEYLANDIFICATION" OF THE BRAND EXPERIENCE**
Rendered as an elegant Art Nouveau banner with flowing letterforms, gold accents, integrated into the ornate top border.

### CENTER HUB: The Bloom
A radiant golden sunburst or grand blooming flower at the center, representing "DISNEYLANDIFICATION." Ornate, luminous, the focal point of the composition. Below: "Users expect Disneyland, not a search bar" on a flowing ribbon banner.

### SPOKE 1 (Top): TWO WORLDS — Mirrored Forms
Two mirrored organic forms contrasting:
- Left: A bare winter branch, grey and dormant — "DISCOVERY" (search, social, generic chat)
- Right: A lush blooming vine, vibrant with flowers — "BRAND EXPERIENCE" (owned surface)
- Ribbon text: "The unbranded experience is generic. The brand experience must delight."

### SPOKE 2 (Upper Right): MORE ACTIONABLE — The Butterfly
A butterfly emerging from a cocoon, wings unfurling:
- Cocoon = static brochure (passive)
- Butterfly = dynamic app (active)
- Banner text: "App, not brochure — Users do things, not just read things"

### SPOKE 3 (Lower Right): TRUST SIGNALS — The Opening Petals
Petals opening to reveal a glowing center, with a stylized figure approaching:
- The petals recognize this specific visitor
- Not a generic barrier but a personalized welcome
- Ribbon text: "Proof points for THIS user at THIS moment"

### SPOKE 4 (Lower Left): MEANINGFUL EVENTS — Seeds & Pollen
Seeds and pollen flowing along tendrils toward a collecting flower:
- Individual seeds labeled: Purchase history, Engagement patterns, Support interactions, Lifecycle stage, Preferences
- Collecting flower labeled "CONTEXT"
- Banner text: "Context is the raw material — Without it, personalisation is guesswork"

### SPOKE 5 (Upper Left): THE PIPELINE — The Stream
A flowing stream/ribbon passing through three blooming stages:
- Stage 1: "CAPTURE EVENTS" — small streams gathering
- Stage 2: "BUILD CONTEXT" — stream pooling around roots of a growing tree
- Stage 3: "DELIVER EXPERIENCE" — water feeding a magnificent bloom
- Ribbon text: "The product equivalent of '10X while having fun'"
