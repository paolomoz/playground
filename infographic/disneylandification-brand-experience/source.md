#### P) "Disneylandification" of the Brand Experience `#product` `#customer` [STRONG]
There are two worlds: **discovery** (outside the brand -- search, social, generic chat) and **brand experience** (inside the brand's owned surface). The unbranded chat experience is generic. The brand experience must delight. Users entering the brand expect Disneyland, not a search bar.

What this means concretely:
- **More actionable** -- the brand experience should feel like an app, not a brochure. Users do things, not just read things.
- **Trust signals** -- find and surface the signals that actually change user behaviour. Not generic badges, but context-aware proof points that matter to *this* user at *this* moment.
- **Meaningful events** -- track events related to the user that are useful to build context. Context is the raw material for exceptional experience. Without it, personalisation is guesswork.

> **-- Loni**

> **Connection to B (Meeting Pipeline) & D (Feedback Pipeline):** The "meaningful events" concept mirrors the team-internal pattern of capturing signals passively and processing them into intelligence. Loni is describing the same architecture applied to the *end user*: capture events --> build context --> deliver personalised experience. The pipeline pattern from Category 1 is also the product architecture.

> **Connection to O (Sustainable Fun):** "Disneylandification" is the product equivalent of "10X while having fun." The user should feel delighted, not overwhelmed. The team should feel the same way about building it.

> **Suggestion:** "Meaningful events" is the concept to unpack. What counts as meaningful? Some candidates: purchase history, content engagement patterns, support interactions, lifecycle stage, expressed preferences vs. revealed preferences. The research question is which events actually move the needle on experience quality -- and which are noise. This is testable.
