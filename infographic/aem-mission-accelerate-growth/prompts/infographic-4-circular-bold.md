Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: circular-flow
- **Style**: bold-graphic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Circular flow showing the mission cycle with bold energy:
- Four major nodes in a circular arrangement: DISCOVER → VALIDATE → SCALE → ENGINEER
- Bold directional arrows between nodes
- Center: "Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption" as the driving force
- Each node bursts with energy and detail about its capabilities
- The cycle should feel dynamic, like a turbine spinning with increasing force
- No start/end — continuous virtuous cycle

## Style Guidelines

Bold-graphic high-contrast comic style:
- Primary colors: Bold primaries — red, yellow, blue, black, with white
- Background: White with halftone patterns and dramatic shadows
- Bold black outlines on all elements
- High contrast compositions
- Halftone dot patterns for texture
- Action lines and motion effects showing the cycle spinning
- Impact fonts for headlines, especially the mission statement
- Speech bubble or caption box callouts for key phrases
- Pop-art energy with "POW" style emphasis on key stats
- The overall feel should be explosive, dynamic, and action-packed
