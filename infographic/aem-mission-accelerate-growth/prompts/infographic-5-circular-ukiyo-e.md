Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: circular-flow
- **Style**: ukiyo-e (Hokusai variant)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy
- This should feel INSPIRING, powerful, majestic, and visionary — like a great force of nature driving unstoppable momentum

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment — brush calligraphy style for titles, clean readable labels with ink-brush character
- Text integrated into composition as banners, cartouches, or scroll elements
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Circular flow showing the mission cycle as a great natural force:
- Four major nodes arranged in a dynamic circular arrangement: DISCOVER → VALIDATE → SCALE → ENGINEER
- The cycle depicted as a powerful circular wave pattern, like Hokusai's Great Wave reimagined as a virtuous cycle
- Flowing directional movement between nodes — water, wind, or wave motifs showing clockwise flow
- No clear start/end — this is a continuous, ever-accelerating cycle like the tides
- Center holds the core mission: "Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption" — rendered as a powerful central force, like the eye of a majestic storm or a sacred mountain
- Each node has associated capabilities radiating outward like branches of cherry blossoms or pine
- The cycle should feel like an unstoppable natural force — inspiring awe and momentum

## Style Guidelines

Ukiyo-e Japanese woodblock print aesthetic (浮世絵) — Hokusai variant with dramatic nature and dynamic movement:
- Primary colors: Indigo blue (ai-iro), vermillion red (shu), Prussian blue (bero-ai)
- Background: Warm cream (unprinted paper white) with bokashi gradient sky effects
- Accents: Safflower pink (beni), yellow ochre (odo), verdigris green (rokusho), sumi black
- Bold, confident black outlines (sumi ink) with varying line weights
- Flat color areas with no gradients within shapes
- Colors appear layered, as if printed sequentially
- Subtle color bleeding at edges (bokashi effect for skies and water)
- Visible wood grain texture suggestion
- Paper texture undertone, matte non-glossy appearance
- Traditional cloud patterns (kumo) as section separators or accents
- Stylized wave patterns connecting the cycle nodes — the Great Wave energy
- Dynamic natural forces: powerful waves, wind, flowing water showing the cycle's momentum
- Brush calligraphy style for titles
- The overall feel should be majestic, powerful, inspiring — like standing before a great natural force
- The cycle should evoke the feeling of an unstoppable tide of innovation

# Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption — The Great Wave of Innovation

A majestic ukiyo-e infographic depicting the virtuous cycle of customer-driven innovation as an unstoppable natural force — a great wave of growth that powers the AEM ecosystem.

## Center Core: The Sacred Mountain (Mount Fuji as metaphor)
"ACCELERATE AEM GROWTH & ADOPTION"
Deeply engaging with customers to drive their success
- Depicted as the immovable, majestic center — like Mount Fuji rising above the swirling cycle
- The mission is the constant around which all energy flows

## Cycle Node 1: DISCOVER — The Rising Tide
- Deeply engaging with customers
- Rapid experimentation
- Close customer partnership
- Identify AI-driven capabilities
- Identify modernization pathways
- Visual metaphor: Dawn breaking over water, explorers setting out, the first wave gathering power
- Energy: curiosity, exploration, the excitement of first discovery

## Cycle Node 2: VALIDATE — The Cresting Wave
- Unlock real value
- Prove AI-driven capabilities work
- Validate modernization pathways through customer outcomes
- Visual metaphor: The wave cresting with power, keys unlocking gates, light breaking through clouds
- Energy: proof, confirmation, the moment of truth

## Cycle Node 3: SCALE — The Great Wave
- Scale the accelerators that drive customer success
- From individual breakthroughs to ecosystem patterns
- Compound acceleration over time
- Visual metaphor: The full power of the Great Wave, multiplying force, a forest growing from seeds
- Energy: unstoppable momentum, multiplication, the peak of power

## Cycle Node 4: ENGINEER — The Flowing Current
- Engineer those breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines
- For the broader AEM ecosystem
- Repeatable, scalable, self-reinforcing
- Visual metaphor: Master craftsmen building, flowing rivers carving permanent channels, bridges connecting islands
- Energy: mastery, permanence, systems that endure

## The Eternal Cycle
Each revolution strengthens the ecosystem. The wave never stops — it grows with each cycle, like the eternal tides. Growth engines create new opportunities for discovery, and the cycle accelerates.
