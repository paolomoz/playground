Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: circular-flow
- **Style**: cyberpunk-neon
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: en

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy
- This should feel INSPIRING, energetic, and visionary

## Text Requirements

- All text must match the specified style treatment
- Main titles should be prominent and readable
- Key concepts should be visually emphasized with neon glow
- Labels should be clear and appropriately sized
- Use English for all text content

## Layout Guidelines

Circular flow showing a continuous virtuous cycle:
- Four major nodes arranged in a circle: DISCOVER → VALIDATE → SCALE → ENGINEER
- Glowing directional arrows between nodes showing clockwise flow
- No clear start/end — this is a continuous, ever-accelerating cycle
- Center holds the core mission: "Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption"
- Each node has associated capabilities/tools radiating outward
- The cycle should feel like it's spinning with energy and momentum

## Style Guidelines

Cyberpunk-neon futuristic aesthetic:
- Primary colors: Neon pink (#FF00FF), cyan (#00FFFF), electric blue
- Background: Deep black (#0A0A0A) with dark purple gradients
- Glowing neon outlines on all elements
- Dark atmospheric background with subtle circuit patterns
- Holographic elements and chrome reflections
- Glowing neon text, digital/tech fonts
- Energy trails and light streaks showing momentum
- The overall feel should be futuristic, powerful, and inspiring

# Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption

An inspiring mission infographic showing the virtuous cycle of customer-driven innovation that powers AEM ecosystem growth.

## Center Core: The Mission
"Accelerate AEM Growth & Adoption"
Deeply engaging with customers to drive their success

## Cycle Node 1: DISCOVER
- Deeply engaging with customers
- Rapid experimentation
- Close customer partnership
- Identify AI-driven capabilities
- Identify modernization pathways

## Cycle Node 2: VALIDATE
- Unlock real value
- Prove AI-driven capabilities work
- Validate modernization pathways through customer outcomes

## Cycle Node 3: SCALE
- Scale the accelerators that drive customer success
- From individual breakthroughs to ecosystem patterns
- Compound acceleration over time

## Cycle Node 4: ENGINEER
- Engineer those breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines
- For the broader AEM ecosystem
- Repeatable, scalable, self-reinforcing

## The Flywheel Effect
Each revolution of the cycle strengthens the ecosystem, creating ever-accelerating growth. The cycle feeds itself — growth engines create new opportunities for discovery.

Text labels (in en):
- Title (center, glowing): "ACCELERATE AEM GROWTH & ADOPTION"
