## Main Topic
A mission statement describing how the AEM team accelerates growth and adoption through deep customer engagement, rapid experimentation, AI-driven capabilities, and engineering breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines for the ecosystem.

## Learning Objectives
After viewing this infographic, the viewer should understand:
1. The core mission: accelerate AEM growth and adoption through customer-centric discovery
2. The method: rapid experimentation and close customer partnership to identify AI-driven capabilities and modernization pathways
3. The outcome: engineering breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines for the broader AEM ecosystem

## Target Audience
- **Knowledge Level**: Intermediate — AEM team members, leadership, partners
- **Context**: Inspiring alignment around team mission and strategic direction
- **Expectations**: Clear understanding of purpose, method, and impact

## Content Type Analysis
- **Data Structure**: Cyclical process — Discover → Validate → Scale → Engineer → Repeat
- **Key Relationships**: Customer engagement feeds discovery; experimentation feeds validation; breakthroughs become repeatable engines; engines feed back into the ecosystem
- **Visual Opportunities**: Flywheel/cycle showing the virtuous loop; rocket/growth metaphor for acceleration; customer partnership as central element; AI as the transformative force

## Key Data Points (Verbatim)
- "accelerate AEM growth and adoption"
- "deeply engaging with customers"
- "discover, validate, and scale the accelerators that drive their success"
- "rapid experimentation"
- "close customer partnership"
- "AI-driven capabilities"
- "modernization pathways"
- "unlock real value"
- "engineer those breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines"
- "broader AEM ecosystem"

## Layout x Style Signals
- Content type: cyclical mission process → suggests circular-flow, hub-spoke, or winding-roadmap
- Tone: inspirational, aspirational, energetic → suggests bold-graphic, cyberpunk-neon, or corporate-memphis
- Audience: internal team/leadership → suggests corporate-memphis or bold-graphic
- Complexity: moderate (7 points) → suggests balanced layout

## Design Instructions (from user input)
- "Inspiring" — the infographic should feel energetic, aspirational, and motivating
- Mission statement context — should feel purposeful and visionary

## Recommended Combinations
1. **circular-flow + cyberpunk-neon** (Recommended): The cyclical discover→validate→scale→engineer loop maps perfectly to circular-flow. Cyberpunk-neon gives it an inspiring, futuristic, high-energy feel that matches the AI-driven innovation theme and the "inspiring" request.
2. **hub-spoke + corporate-memphis**: Central hub as "Accelerate AEM Growth" with spokes to each capability (customer engagement, experimentation, AI, modernization, growth engines). Clean and professional.
3. **winding-roadmap + storybook-watercolor**: The journey from discovery to repeatable growth engines as an inspiring path. Watercolor gives it a warm, aspirational feel.
4. **circular-flow + bold-graphic**: Same cyclical structure but with high-contrast comic energy, making the mission feel dynamic and action-oriented.
