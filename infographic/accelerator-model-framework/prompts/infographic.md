Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression
- **Style**: technical-schematic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Layout Guidelines (linear-progression)

Sequential progression showing steps in the accelerator lifecycle.

- Linear horizontal arrangement flowing left to right
- Four major nodes with connecting lines/arrows
- Clear start point (Experiment) and end point (Made to Product)
- Step numbers or labels at each node
- Below the main progression, three impact phases shown as colored zones
- Consistent node spacing with directional flow indicators
- Title at top, step titles at each node, descriptions below

## Style Guidelines (technical-schematic)

Technical diagrams with engineering precision and clean geometry (Blueprint variant).

- **Color Palette**: Blues (#2563EB), teals, grays, white lines on deep blue (#1E3A5F) background. Amber highlights (#F59E0B) for emphasis, cyan callouts.
- **Visual Elements**: Geometric precision throughout, grid pattern background, dimension lines and annotations, technical symbols, clean vector shapes, consistent stroke weights
- **Typography**: Technical stencil or clean sans-serif, ALL-CAPS labels, measurement-style annotations

# The Accelerator Model

A technical schematic showing the four-stage accelerator lifecycle and three impact phases.

## Main Progression (Left to Right):

### Stage 1: EXPERIMENT
- Hypothesis-driven, rapid iteration
- Visual: Flask/beaker icon with geometric precision
- Status: Starting point

### Stage 2: CUSTOMER USE
- Real customer tries it
- Visual: User/person icon in technical style
- Connected by arrow from Stage 1

### Stage 3: VALIDATED
- Proven impact with customer evidence
- Visual: Checkmark/verification badge icon
- Connected by arrow from Stage 2

### Stage 4: MADE TO PRODUCT
- Becomes an established part of AEM
- Visual: Package/product box icon
- Connected by arrow from Stage 3, endpoint

## Three Impact Phases (Below progression as colored zones):

### Phase A: ACQUISITION
- Attracting new customers
- Zone color: Cyan/teal
- Maps to early stages

### Phase B: ADOPTION
- Turning buyers into active AEM users
- Zone color: Amber
- Maps to middle stages

### Phase C: EXPANSION
- Increasing usage and value
- Zone color: Blue
- Maps to later stages

## Operating Model (Side panel):
- 5-7 customer engagements running in parallel
- 1-2 people per experiment
- Fast cycles, small bets

## Proof Point Callout:
- Skoda POC: Experience Catalyst imported 200 pages → decision maker flipped to EDS

## Established Initiatives (Bottom):
- Experience Catalyst — accelerating migration and adoption
- Digital Insights — intelligent value discovery and personalisation

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "THE ACCELERATOR MODEL"
- Stages: "EXPERIMENT", "CUSTOMER USE", "VALIDATED", "MADE TO PRODUCT"
- Phases: "ACQUISITION", "ADOPTION", "EXPANSION"
- Operating model: "5-7 PARALLEL ENGAGEMENTS | 1-2 PEOPLE EACH | FAST CYCLES"
- Proof point: "SKODA POC: 200 PAGES → EDS ADOPTION"
- Initiatives: "EXPERIENCE CATALYST", "DIGITAL INSIGHTS"
