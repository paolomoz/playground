# The Accelerator Model

## What Is an Accelerator?
Any contribution that raises the value line at any stage of the customer journey. From a better demo to a migration tool — anything that moves the needle.

## Accelerator Lifecycle (4 Stages)
1. **Experiment** — hypothesis-driven, rapid iteration
2. **Customer Use** — real customer tries it
3. **Validated** — proven impact with customer evidence
4. **Made to Product** — becomes an established part of AEM

## Three Impact Phases
- **Acquisition** — attracting new customers
- **Adoption** — turning buyers into active AEM users
- **Expansion** — increasing usage and value

## Pancake Chart Methodology
Inspired by Philippe Kocic's Astra team. Innovation flows: Experience → Learning → Hypothesis → Experiment → Customer Engagement → Product.

## Operating Model
- 5-7 customer engagements running in parallel
- 1-2 people per experiment
- Fast cycles, small bets

## Proof Point: Skoda POC
Experience Catalyst imported 200 pages for a Skoda website demo. The decision maker who had been resisting EDS said "let's go with EDS" after seeing the POC.

## Established Initiatives
- **Experience Catalyst** — accelerating migration and adoption
- **Digital Insights** — intelligent value discovery and personalisation
