Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: circular-flow
- **Style**: cyberpunk-neon
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Core Principles

- Follow the layout structure precisely for information architecture
- Apply style aesthetics consistently throughout
- Keep information concise, highlight keywords and core concepts
- Use ample whitespace for visual clarity
- Maintain clear visual hierarchy

## Layout Guidelines (circular-flow)

Cyclic process showing the AI-first transformation as a continuous cycle.

- Circular arrangement of the key transformation elements
- Steps around the circle connected by directional arrows
- No clear start/end — represents continuous improvement
- Center holds the main concept (10x delivery)
- Nodes evenly spaced around the circle
- Title at top, step labels at each node, center concept prominent

## Style Guidelines (cyberpunk-neon)

Neon glow on dark backgrounds, futuristic aesthetic.

- **Color Palette**: Neon pink (#FF00FF), cyan (#00FFFF), electric blue on deep black (#0A0A0A) or dark purple gradient background. Neon glow effects, chrome reflections.
- **Visual Elements**: Glowing neon outlines, dark atmospheric background, digital glitch effects, circuit patterns, holographic elements
- **Typography**: Glowing neon text, digital/tech fonts, outlined glow letters

# AI-First Future

A circular flow showing the continuous AI-first transformation cycle with "Deliver 10x" at the center.

## Center: The Goal
- "DELIVER 10X"
- "by working 0.5X"
- Visual: Large glowing neon text, holographic effect, pulsing energy

## Cycle Node 1: VIBE CODING
- Vibe coding everything possible
- Visual: Code brackets icon with neon glow, circuit patterns
- Color: Neon cyan

## Cycle Node 2: AI-ASSISTED PLANNING
- AI-assisted planning and decision-making
- Visual: Brain/neural network icon with electric blue glow
- Color: Electric blue

## Cycle Node 3: AI CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT
- AI for customer engagement and content creation
- Visual: People/handshake icon with holographic effect
- Color: Neon pink

## Cycle Node 4: LEARN & EXPERIMENT
- Invest in the team — learn new ways of working
- Workshop: 80-90% hands-on AI adoption
- Visual: Lightbulb/lab flask icon with glitch effect
- Color: Neon purple

## Cycle Node 5: SPEED OF EXECUTION
- Cloud Co-Work: idea to release in ~2 weeks (Claude Code)
- Experience Catalyst: prototype in 3-4 days, users in 1 week
- "What has fundamentally changed is the speed" — Karl Pauls
- Visual: Lightning bolt icon with speed lines, neon trails
- Color: Neon yellow/amber

## Arrows between nodes:
- Glowing directional arrows connecting each node to the next
- Circuit-pattern trails along the arrows
- Continuous flow, no start/end

## Quote Callout (Bottom):
- "Nothing is set in stone yet. This is an invite to all of you to help us shape and create." — Nicole Glauser
- Neon glow text on dark background

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "AI-FIRST FUTURE"
- Center: "DELIVER 10X | WORK 0.5X"
- Nodes: "VIBE CODING", "AI-ASSISTED PLANNING", "AI CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT", "LEARN & EXPERIMENT", "SPEED OF EXECUTION"
- Speed examples: "2 weeks: idea → release", "3-4 days: prototype → users"
- Quote: "Nothing is set in stone yet. This is an invite to all of you to help us shape and create."
