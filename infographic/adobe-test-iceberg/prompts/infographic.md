Create a clean, high-contrast infographic in Adobe's design language. Bold structure, vibrant imagery, not messy.

## Style: Clean Adobe — structured, bold, professional
- BLACK (#000000) and dark sections for below-waterline
- #EB1000 red accents
- Clean typography, proper spacing
- Adobe Clean font: Black for headlines, Regular for body
- Proper greys: #F5F5F5, #E8E8E8, #666666

## Topic: What Users See vs. What Designers Do — The Design Iceberg

Iceberg layout: polished surface above, massive hidden work below.

## LAYOUT

### TOP SECTION — Above the waterline (clean, bright, minimal)
White or #F5F5F5 light background. Clean, airy, minimal.

- "The Design Iceberg" in massive bold #000000 headline at the very top
- A beautiful, polished device mockup (phone or laptop) showing a clean UI — centered, floating with subtle shadow
- "What users see" in bold #000000
- "simple." in large #EB1000 red italic — ironic understatement
- Pill tags: "clean interface", "intuitive", "it just works" in #B9E0DB mint pills
- Maximum whitespace — this section should feel effortlessly minimal

### WATERLINE — Bold red divider
A clean horizontal line or band in #EB1000 red spanning the full width
- "THE SURFACE" label in bold white on the red band

### BELOW WATERLINE — The hidden work (dark, dense, layered)
Background transitions from #333333 to #000000 as you go down. This section is 3× taller than the above section.

4 horizontal rows, each a clean dark card or section:

**ROW 1 — "User Research"**
Dark card on #333333 background. Photo of sticky notes and interview setup.
- Bold white headline: "user research"
- "500 interviews" in large #EB1000 red number
- Body in #CCCCCC: "Understanding real people before designing for them"

**ROW 2 — "Wireframes & Prototypes"**
Darker card on #222222 background. Photo of wireframe sketches and prototypes.
- Bold white headline: "wireframes & prototypes"
- "200 iterations" in large #FEA8EC pink number
- Body in #CCCCCC: "Testing, failing, and rebuilding — 200 times"

**ROW 3 — "Design Systems"**
Even darker, #111111. Photo of component libraries and color swatches.
- Bold white headline: "design systems"
- "10,000 decisions" in large #FBE87A yellow number
- Body in #CCCCCC: "Every spacing unit, every color, every interaction — decided deliberately"

**ROW 4 — "Accessibility & Testing"**
Pure #000000 black. Deepest level.
- Bold white headline: "accessibility & testing"
- "every edge case" in #EB1000 red
- Body in #CCCCCC: "Screen readers, color contrast, device testing, error states"

### BOTTOM
"what designers do" in bold #EB1000 red on black, centered, large

## CLEAN DESIGN RULES
- Clear horizontal layering — each row is distinct and organized
- Progressive darkening from top to bottom creates the iceberg depth effect
- Numbers are large and colorful against the dark backgrounds — the hero elements
- Above waterline is airy and minimal, below is dense and dark — the contrast IS the story
- NOT a collage, NOT messy — structured vertical descent
- Generous padding within each row
