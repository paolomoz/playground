Create a warm, optimistic infographic in a modern soft-gradient aesthetic — floating cards, pastel colors, playful decorative elements. Think Adobe Express marketing page, not a corporate slide.

## Topic: AI Evolution Framework — 4 Levels to AI Native Team

A hierarchy of 4 maturity levels, stacking upward. The key insight: Level 4 is NOT "everyone at Level 3" — it's shared infrastructure and culture.

## LAYOUT

### Background
Full-bleed dreamy gradient from sky blue (left/bottom) through lavender (center) to blush pink (right/top). Soft and cloudy, slightly misty. Electric lime green (#C4FF4D) hand-drawn squiggle doodles looping playfully in the background — thick, organic curves swooping behind the cards.

### TITLE AREA (top center)
"AI Evolution Framework" in large bold #1A1A2E near-black, clean sans-serif
Subtitle: "4 levels to AI native team" in #4A4A6A
Two pill tags floating beside it: "#culture" in a #00B894 green pill with white text, "#learning" in a #FF6B8A pink pill with white text
A small holographic 3D star floating near the title

### MAIN: 4 floating cards stacking upward

4 white rounded cards, each floating higher than the last with deeper shadows. Cards are slightly tilted at casual angles (not rigid grid). Each card rises higher, suggesting progression. A playful lime green squiggle line connects them from bottom to top, looping between cards.

**CARD 1 — Level 1: "AI User" (bottom, largest card)**
White card with soft shadow, floating lowest. Slight rightward tilt.
- A small rounded badge: "LEVEL 1" in white text on #5B4FD6 indigo pill
- "AI User" in bold #1A1A2E headline
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Uses AI tools when prompted. Copy-paste into ChatGPT. Occasional assistance."
- A warm pink (#FF6B8A) callout sticker: "← most of the team is here" — like a chat bubble or sticky note
- Small icon: person at desk with chat bubble
- Yellow smiley sticker floating near the corner

**CARD 2 — Level 2: "AI First" (second level)**
White card floating higher, slight leftward tilt. Smaller than Card 1.
- Badge: "LEVEL 2" in white on #7C5FD6 purple pill
- "AI First" in bold #1A1A2E headline
- Body in #4A4A6A: "AI is the default starting point. Every task begins with 'how would AI approach this?'"
- Small icon: person surrounded by multiple floating tool windows
- A small holographic star floating nearby

**CARD 3 — Level 3: "AI Native Individual" (third level)**
White card with a subtle pale lilac (#E8D5F5) tint, floating higher still. A bit smaller.
- Badge: "LEVEL 3" in white on #5B4FD6 indigo pill
- "AI Native Individual" in bold #1A1A2E headline
- Body in #4A4A6A: "AI embedded in workflow. Custom prompts, agents, automations. Thinks in human+AI systems."
- A bright #FFD93D yellow callout: "TARGET: every individual here ★" — warm, aspirational
- Small icon: person and AI merging, flowing together

**CARD 4 — Level 4: "AI Native Team" (top, smallest card)**
White card with a soft indigo (#5B4FD6) left border accent, floating highest with the deepest shadow. The pinnacle.
- Badge: "LEVEL 4" in white on #5B4FD6 indigo pill
- "AI Native Team" in bold #1A1A2E headline
- Body in #4A4A6A: "Shared infrastructure and culture that makes AI-native the default — even for new joiners"
- Small icon: connected team silhouettes with glowing network lines
- Multiple holographic 3D stars clustered near this card — it's the summit

### KEY INSIGHT (bottom center)
A frosted glass panel (semi-transparent white with blur) floating below the card stack:
- Large "≠" symbol in #5B4FD6 indigo

- Lime green squiggle doodles looping in the background
- 2-3 small yellow smiley face stickers scattered playfully
- Small pink hearts floating as confetti
- Everything feels light, warm, optimistic, floating

### BOTTOM

## DESIGN RULES
- Cards FLOAT at different heights — not rigidly grid-aligned, slightly tilted, casual and friendly
- Soft gradient background fills edge to edge — no flat white sections
- Playful decorative elements (squiggles, stickers, stars) add warmth without overwhelming
- Typography is clean, rounded, friendly — never aggressive or corporate
- The overall feeling is OPTIMISTIC and WARM — like a modern tech product landing page
- NOT dark, NOT corporate, NOT minimal — this is colorful, playful, people-friendly
