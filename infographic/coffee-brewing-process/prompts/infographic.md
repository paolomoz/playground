Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: linear-progression (horizontal process flow)
- **Style**: memphis (1980s Memphis Group postmodern design)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (landscape)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

### Linear Progression Layout

Sequential horizontal flow showing steps in a process.

**Structure:**
- Horizontal arrangement from left to right
- Numbered nodes/markers at each step
- Connecting path between nodes (use zigzag path, not a straight line — Memphis style)
- Clear start and end points
- Directional flow indicators

**Text Placement:**
- Title at top
- Step titles at each node
- Brief descriptions below nodes
- Numbers clearly visible

## Style Guidelines

### Memphis Design Style (1980s Postmodern)

Loud, clashing, deliberately "bad taste" 1980s postmodern design — hot pink triangles colliding with acid yellow zigzags on a speckled terrazzo background, thick black outlines around everything, squiggly lines crawling across surfaces. Ettore Sottsass meets Nathalie du Pasquier. Maximalist, irreverent, unapologetically fun.

**Color Palette:**
- Primary: Hot pink (#E84393), electric blue (#0984E3), acid yellow (#FDCB6E)
- Background: White with terrazzo confetti speckles
- Darks: True black (#000000) for thick outlines
- Accents: Teal green (#00CEC9), coral red (#FF6348), lavender purple (#A29BFE), mint green (#55EFC4)

**MUST include:**
- **Thick black outlines** around every shape (4-6px)
- **Zigzag/chevron bands** as connectors and decorative borders
- **Terrazzo/confetti speckle** on backgrounds
- **Bold geometric shapes** — each step marker a different shape (triangle, circle, semicircle, rectangle)
- **Clashing pattern fills** — each step panel has a DIFFERENT pattern (dots, stripes, crosshatch, zigzags)
- **Squiggly lines** as decorative accents
- **NO gradients, NO shadows, NO 3D** — flat and boldly outlined
- Heavy bold sans-serif all-caps typography

**Anti-Patterns:**
- NOT corporate Memphis (Silicon Valley flat illustration)
- NOT clean/tidy — must be loud, pattern-on-pattern, clashing
- Must look like Sottsass furniture showroom exploded onto paper

# HOW TO BREW THE PERFECT COFFEE

A 4-step process flow from left to right.

## TITLE (top banner):
"HOW TO BREW THE PERFECT COFFEE"
Bold Memphis typography on a hot pink zigzag-striped banner with thick black outline.

## STEP 1 — GRIND:
Number: Bold circled "1" in acid yellow
Headline: "GRIND"
Visual: Coffee grinder as bold geometric shapes — cylinder body, triangle hopper, circle dial — thick black outlines, on electric blue background with polka dot pattern
Label: "Medium-coarse for pour over"

## STEP 2 — HEAT:
Number: Bold circled "2" in hot pink
Headline: "HEAT WATER"
Visual: Kettle as geometric triangle + circle, steam as squiggly lines rising — on acid yellow background with diagonal stripe pattern
Label: "200°F / 93°C"

## STEP 3 — POUR:
Number: Bold circled "3" in teal green
Headline: "POUR"
Visual: Water stream as zigzag line pouring into cup (rectangle + semicircle), on coral background with crosshatch pattern
Label: "Circular motion, 4 minutes"

## STEP 4 — ENJOY:
Number: Bold circled "4" in lavender
Headline: "ENJOY"
Visual: Coffee cup as bold geometric shapes — semicircle handle, rectangle body, steam as squiggly lines — on mint green background with chevron pattern
Label: "Best served fresh"

**CONNECTION**: Steps connected by a bold zigzag path in clashing colors (not a straight arrow). Each step's background panel has a DIFFERENT color and DIFFERENT pattern fill.

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "HOW TO BREW THE PERFECT COFFEE"
- Step 1: "GRIND" / "Medium-coarse for pour over"
- Step 2: "HEAT WATER" / "200°F / 93°C"
- Step 3: "POUR" / "Circular motion, 4 minutes"
- Step 4: "ENJOY" / "Best served fresh"
