Create a professional infographic following these specifications:

## Image Specifications

- **Type**: Infographic
- **Layout**: iceberg (surface vs hidden depths)
- **Style**: matsumoto (Taiyo Matsumoto-inspired loose expressive ink, urban)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 (portrait)
- **Language**: English

## Layout Guidelines

### Iceberg Layout

Surface vs hidden depths. A clear dividing line separates the visible top from the larger hidden bottom.

**Structure:**
- Waterline dividing visible/hidden — rendered as a street-level horizon line
- Above: smaller, brighter (what tourists see)
- Below: larger, darker, denser (the real city underneath)
- Proportional: below should be 2-3x larger than above

## Style Guidelines

### Matsumoto Style — Loose Expressive Urban Ink

Loose, scratchy black ink on rough off-white paper. Dense urban environments, exaggerated characters, tangled wires. Watercolor washes for accent color. Crosshatching for shadows. Everything hand-drawn. Buildings lean and breathe.

**Palette:** Black ink dominant. Off-white paper (#F0E6D0). Accents: warm orange (#E8915A), sky blue (#A8C8E8), rust red (#C85A4A), weathered teal (#6B9B8A), dusty purple (#9B8BA8).

**MUST include:** Loose varying ink lines, crosshatching, ink splatters, tangled wires, dense urban detail, exaggerated characters, watercolor washes, visible paper texture, hand-lettered text.

**NOT:** Clean manga, sumi-e, storybook watercolor, or polished illustration.

# THE CITY BENEATH THE SURFACE

An iceberg-style infographic showing what's visible about a city above the "surface line" vs. the hidden reality below. Portrait orientation — tall and vertical. The surface line is the street level.

## TITLE (very top, hand-lettered):
"THE CITY BENEATH THE SURFACE"
Loose brush-lettered title with ink splatters.

## ABOVE THE SURFACE (top 1/3 — what you see):

The visible city skyline and street level — rendered in lighter ink, more sketchy, with sky blue watercolor wash and warm light. This is the tourist's city, clean and bright.

Items (scattered as labels with small illustrations):
- "SKYLINE" — Tall buildings sketched loosely against a blue-washed sky, power lines crossing
- "TOURIST SPOTS" — A small figure with camera and oversized head looking up at buildings
- "CLEAN STREETS" — A tidy street scene with a single tree, light sketchy lines
- "FAMOUS FOOD" — A nice restaurant front with a sign

**The surface line / street level** — rendered as a thick horizontal ink line with small figures walking along it, like ants on a horizon. Label: "STREET LEVEL" in hand-lettered text.

## BELOW THE SURFACE (bottom 2/3 — the hidden city):

The real city underneath — denser, darker, more crosshatched, with deeper ink work. This is the city residents know. The deeper you go, the denser and darker the ink.

### Layer 1 (just below surface):
- "BACK ALLEYS" — Dense narrow alleys between buildings, scooters, hanging laundry, pipes. Medium crosshatching. Warm orange wash.
- "LOCAL DINERS" — Tiny cramped ramen counter, steam rising, cook with big head. Warm yellow wash.

### Layer 2 (middle depth):
- "SUBWAY TUNNELS" — Underground train tunnels rendered in heavy crosshatching, a train passing through. Blue-gray wash.
- "HIDDEN BARS" — A tiny door in a basement wall, barely visible, with a small red lantern. Rust red accent.
- "NIGHT MARKETS" — Dense stalls with tiny figures, lanterns, chaotic energy. Warm orange wash.

### Layer 3 (deepest):
- "UNDERGROUND RIVERS" — Flowing water under the city, ancient pipes and tunnels. Dense black ink, wavy lines for water. Teal/blue wash.
- "FORGOTTEN HISTORY" — Crumbling old structures, graffiti on ancient walls. The densest ink work, almost solid black with white scratched out.

**DEPTH GRADIENT:** Ink density should increase dramatically from top to bottom. The surface is light and sketchy with lots of white paper showing. The deepest layer is almost solid black with dense crosshatching, barely any white paper left. Watercolor washes get cooler and darker going down — from warm orange near surface to cold blue/teal at the depths.

**Power lines should appear in the above-surface section. Below-surface should have pipes and utility lines running through instead.**

Text labels (in English):
- Title: "THE CITY BENEATH THE SURFACE"
- Surface line: "STREET LEVEL"
- Above: "SKYLINE" / "TOURIST SPOTS" / "CLEAN STREETS" / "FAMOUS FOOD"
- Below Layer 1: "BACK ALLEYS" / "LOCAL DINERS"
- Below Layer 2: "SUBWAY TUNNELS" / "HIDDEN BARS" / "NIGHT MARKETS"
- Below Layer 3: "UNDERGROUND RIVERS" / "FORGOTTEN HISTORY"
