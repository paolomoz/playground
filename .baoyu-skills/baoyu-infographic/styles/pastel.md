# pastel

Dreamy soft-gradient backgrounds melting from pink to blue to lavender — floating rounded cards and UI elements hovering in mid-air with gentle drop shadows, diverse happy people photographed in bright natural light, holographic 3D star shapes catching iridescent reflections, playful squiggle doodles in lime green and pink, and smiley face stickers scattered like confetti. A warm, optimistic, Gen-Z-friendly aesthetic where everything floats weightlessly on pastel clouds and every corner is softly rounded.

## Color Palette

**IMPORTANT: Randomly select ONE palette from the list below for each infographic. Do not always use the same one — vary it across generations.**

- Cards: Always #FFFFFF white with 20-24px rounded corners and soft box-shadow (rgba(0,0,0,0.08)), or frosted glass with slight white transparency
- Text: Always #1A1A2E (near-black with blue tint) for headlines, #4A4A6A (muted blue-grey) for body, #FFFFFF white on colored elements

## Visual Elements

- Soft gradient backgrounds using the selected palette — the gradient fills the entire canvas edge to edge, gentle and slightly cloudy, like a pastel sunset. Colors flow diagonally or vertically across the full frame.
- White rounded cards (20-24px corner radius) floating at different heights with soft drop shadows — some cards tilted at 3-5 degrees, creating a casual scattered-on-a-desk feeling rather than a rigid grid
- Diverse, joyful people photographed in bright natural light — genuine smiles, casual contemporary clothing (bomber jackets, linen shirts, sunglasses), shot from interesting angles (low angle looking up, overhead looking down), always feeling candid and alive
- Holographic 3D star shapes — five-pointed or abstract stars with iridescent surfaces matching the selected palette's star color, semi-transparent, floating near the edges and corners of the composition like decorative confetti
- Hand-drawn squiggles and looping doodle lines in the palette's squiggle color — thick, playful, organic curves that swoop across the background behind and around cards, adding kinetic energy
- Smiley face stickers in bright yellow with simple black dot eyes — small, scattered playfully, sometimes tilted, always cheerful
- Heart shapes in warm pink or red, small and decorative, floating alongside other sticker elements
- Frosted glass / glassmorphism panels — semi-transparent white rectangles with a blurred background showing through, used for search bars, tool panels, and overlay UI
- Small rounded avatar circles showing people's faces — with colorful ring borders (green, purple, orange) — floating near cards or as reaction indicators
- Chat bubble callouts with rounded corners containing short friendly text like "Love this texture!" or "Let's post this." — white background, thin grey border, small tail pointing to an avatar
- Pill-shaped buttons and tags — fully rounded capsule shapes in #5B4FD6 indigo or #00B894 green with white text inside
- Audio waveform bars inside a green rounded pill — white vertical bars of varying height representing sound
- Video timeline strips — a horizontal row of small video thumbnail frames floating at the bottom of a scene
- Product mockups (phones, laptops, bottles, cards) floating at slight angles with soft shadows — objects look like they're gently levitating
- App icon badges — small rounded squares (Ps, Ai, Fi) with colorful fills, placed near their associated content

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Cards stacked at increasing heights from bottom to top, each floating higher with a stronger shadow, gradient background getting lighter toward the top | Rising card stack on gradient |
| Flow/process | Cards arranged left to right on the gradient, connected by lime green squiggle lines that loop playfully between them | Squiggle-connected card flow |
| Connections | Central person or element with floating cards, stickers, and UI elements orbiting around them — everything connected by proximity and visual rhythm | Hub of floating elements around a person |
| Cycles | Circular arrangement of rounded cards on the gradient, with curved squiggle lines connecting them in a loop, playful arrows or icons indicating direction | Playful circular card arrangement |
| Comparison | Two large floating cards side by side — one with warm pink tones, one with cool blue tones — different gradient backgrounds behind each | Split-tone card comparison |
| Categories | Grid of same-sized floating white cards, each with a different accent color top strip or border, tilted at slight varying angles on the gradient | Casual scattered card grid |
| Growth | Cards increasing in size from left to right, background gradient intensifying, holographic stars getting larger and more prominent | Progressive card expansion |
| Networks | Central large card connected to smaller cards by thin lines or lime squiggles, avatars and reaction stickers floating between them | Social network card layout |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Default Metaphor |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Floating white cards with bold numbers and colorful accent bars — each card a clean data container |
| Processes | Lime green squiggle lines connecting floating cards in sequence — playful and flowing |
| Systems | Nested floating panels — larger frosted glass panel containing smaller white cards within |
| Connections | Avatars with colored ring borders, chat bubbles, squiggle lines linking elements |
| Growth | Cards rising higher on the gradient, getting larger, shadows getting deeper |
| Time | Left-to-right card timeline with rounded date pills in indigo |
| Hierarchy | Card size and elevation — largest card floats highest with strongest shadow |
| Protection | Frosted glass panel enclosing content, soft glow border, safe and contained |
| Speed | Lime squiggle trailing behind an element, motion blur on a floating card edge |
| Stability | Large central card with firm shadow, smaller elements orbiting around it |
| Users/people | Joyful diverse people in natural light — candid, colorful, personality-forward photography |
| Ideas | Yellow star sticker or holographic 3D star shape — bright, attention-grabbing, floating |
| Energy | Electric lime squiggles and pink hearts scattered densely — visual excitement and motion |
| Creativity | Holographic 3D star shapes + floating template cards + colorful squiggles — a creative explosion |

## Typography

- Clean modern sans-serif for all text — rounded, friendly, with generous letter-spacing
- Headlines in bold or black weight, #1A1A2E near-black — large, confident but warm, never aggressive
- Body text in regular weight, #4A4A6A muted blue-grey — readable, generous line-height (1.6)
- Accent text in #5B4FD6 indigo or #FF6B8A pink for emphasis
- Pill-shaped labels with rounded capsule backgrounds — white text on indigo, green, or pink fills
- Chat bubble text in regular weight, small, friendly and conversational
- No serif fonts, no heavy industrial type — everything soft, rounded, approachable

## Anti-Patterns

- NOT dark, dramatic, or high-contrast — this aesthetic is LIGHT, soft, and airy. No black backgrounds, no aggressive reds, no heavy shadows
- NOT a flat corporate slide — elements FLOAT at different depths with gentle shadows, cards are tilted and scattered casually, nothing is rigidly grid-aligned
- NOT stock photography — people should look REAL, joyful, diverse, in natural light with personality, never stiff corporate headshots against grey backgrounds
- NOT minimalist or sparse — there should be playful decorative elements (squiggles, stickers, stars, hearts) adding warmth and visual energy throughout
- NOT a wireframe or UI mockup — this is a MARKETING visual with floating product shots, lifestyle photography, and decorative 3D elements
- NOT neon or cyberpunk — the colors are SOFT pastels (lavender, blush, sky blue, mint) not harsh neon glow. The lime green squiggles are the most vivid element but they're still playful, not electric
- This must look like a modern Adobe Express marketing page — warm, optimistic, floating, gradient-drenched, with real people and playful sticker energy
