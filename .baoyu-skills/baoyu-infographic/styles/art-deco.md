# art-deco

Opulent geometric glamour of the 1920s-30s — polished gold lines slicing across deep black backgrounds, stepped ziggurat silhouettes rising in perfect symmetry, radiating sunburst fans catching the light, and jewel-toned panels framed in gleaming brass. This is the Chrysler Building lobby, a Great Gatsby ballroom, a luxury ocean liner's first-class lounge — angular, lavish, and unapologetically dramatic.

### Palette Combinations

| Combination | Colors |
|-------------|--------|
| Gatsby | Polished gold + deep black + ivory cream — the classic Art Deco tuxedo palette, maximum drama |
| Jewel Box | Emerald green + gold + black + ivory — lush and opulent like a Cartier display |
| Midnight Sapphire | Deep sapphire blue + silver/chrome + black + warm white — cool, sophisticated, cinematic |
| Ruby Lounge | Ruby red + gold + black + cream — warm, theatrical, bold |
| Chrome Modern | Silver/chrome + black + white + teal accent — streamlined, machine-age sleek |

## Variants

| Variant | Focus | Visual Emphasis |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Gatsby** | Maximum gold-on-black glamour | Thick gold lines forming geometric frames, radiating sunbursts, chevron borders, fan motifs — everything gleams against velvety black like a 1920s invitation |
| **Streamline** | Machine-age chrome elegance | Horizontal speed lines, aerodynamic curves within geometric structure, silver/chrome instead of gold, ocean liner and locomotive aesthetic — sleek rather than ornate |
| **Ziggurat** | Stepped architectural drama | Terraced pyramidal forms rising symmetrically, layered setback silhouettes, Egyptian-influenced geometry, monumental scale — the Chrysler Building as a composition principle |
| **Tropical Deco** | Miami Beach pastel warmth | Softer palette — flamingo pink, seafoam green, pale coral, cream — with geometric patterns and sunburst motifs, lighter and more playful while retaining Art Deco structure |

## Visual Elements

- Thick polished gold lines forming bold geometric frames, borders, and dividers on deep black backgrounds — lines that gleam with metallic sheen, not flat yellow
- Radiating sunburst fans: thin gold lines fanning outward from a semicircular base, like a rising sun or peacock tail — the signature Art Deco motif
- Stepped/terraced ziggurat silhouettes: forms that ascend in symmetrical staircase tiers, each level slightly narrower, like a skyscraper crown
- Fan/scallop patterns: overlapping semicircles in rows creating a fish-scale or shell-like repeating motif, each scale catching light at a different angle
- Chevron and zigzag borders: sharp V-shapes repeating in bands, like lightning bolts frozen into ornamental trim
- Fluted vertical lines: tight parallel grooves creating rhythm and texture on columns and panels, like fluted glass or corrugated metal
- Keystone and arch forms: tall pointed arches and trapezoidal keystones as framing devices for central content
- Egyptian and Aztec geometric motifs: stylized lotus flowers, stepped pyramids, angular eagles with spread wings
- Symmetrical bilateral compositions: everything mirrored around a strong central axis, creating a sense of grand formality
- High-contrast metallic surfaces: polished gold, brushed brass, gleaming chrome catching highlights against matte black — surfaces that look expensive and reflective
- Jewel-toned accent panels: small rectangles or geometric insets filled with emerald, sapphire, or ruby, set like precious stones into the gold framework
- Bold geometric borders framing the entire composition: an ornamental outer frame of stepped lines, chevrons, or scallops containing the content
- NO organic flowing curves (that's Art Nouveau), NO freeform shapes, NO rough textures — everything is precise, angular, polished, and machined

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Central stepped ziggurat rising upward — most important at the gleaming crown, supporting tiers descending symmetrically below | Chrysler Building's terraced crown — each level a step in importance |
| Flow/process | Horizontal streamlined bands flowing left to right, each step marked by a vertical gold divider with a sunburst or fan ornament at the transition | Ocean liner deck promenades — sleek horizontal movement with ornamental punctuation |
| Connections | Gold lines radiating from a central sunburst hub, connecting to nodes arranged symmetrically around the perimeter | Art Deco ceiling medallion — central rosette with geometric rays reaching outward |
| Cycles | Concentric geometric frames — nested rectangles or octagons, each level outlined in gold, creating depth inward like a tunnel of golden frames | Repeating arch portals in Art Deco lobbies, each frame stepping deeper |
| Comparison | Mirrored panels flanking a central divider — left and right in perfect bilateral symmetry, each side in a contrasting jewel tone | Twin elevator doors in a Deco lobby — matched but distinct panels |
| Categories | Distinct geometric panels (rectangles, pointed arches, or fan-topped frames) arranged in a symmetrical grid, each bordered in gold and filled with its own jewel-tone background | Art Deco stained glass window — compartmentalized geometric panels |
| Growth | Ascending stepped bars or columns, each taller than the last, rising like a city skyline silhouette with setback tiers | Manhattan skyline of Art Deco towers, each step higher and more ornate |
| Networks | Geometric lattice of gold lines forming a diamond or chevron grid, with content nodes at each intersection point | Art Deco metalwork grilles — intricate geometric lattice patterns |
| Timeline | Horizontal band with vertical gold pillar dividers at each date, topped with fan/sunburst ornaments, content panels between the pillars | Art Deco frieze — repeating vertical panels along a horizontal narrative band |
| Parts of a whole | Central geometric mandala with wedge-shaped segments radiating outward, each in a different jewel tone, bordered by gold lines | Art Deco clock face or compass rose — geometric radial divisions |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Art Deco Metaphor |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Data/information | Gleaming gold bars of proportional height rising against black, like a gilded city skyline |
| Processes | Streamlined horizontal bands with chevron arrows, flowing left to right with machined precision |
| Systems | Interlocking geometric lattice — gold diamond grid or hexagonal framework containing components |
| Connections | Gold rays radiating from a central sunburst, each ray linking to a node |
| Growth | Ascending stepped ziggurat tiers, each level crowned with an increasingly elaborate sunburst |
| Time | Horizontal frieze of equally-spaced gold pillars marking intervals, fan ornaments at milestones |
| Hierarchy | Central crowned tower flanked by progressively shorter flanking structures — a skyline of importance |
| Protection | Ornamental gold border frame with stepped corners enclosing protected content — a vault of precious information |
| Speed | Streamlined horizontal speed lines converging at a point, chrome and silver palette, aerodynamic curves |
| Stability | Massive stepped pyramid base, wide at bottom and narrowing upward — monumental and anchored |
| Users/people | Stylized angular figures with geometric hairstyles and clothing, like Tamara de Lempicka portraits — bold, glamorous, sharply defined |
| Ideas | Radiating gold sunburst with rays piercing outward from a bright center — illumination as literal golden light |
| Energy | Zigzag lightning bolt motifs in gold on black, chevrons pointing upward, dynamic angular thrust |
| Luxury/value | Jewel-toned panel set into gold framework — emerald or sapphire inset like a precious stone in a setting |
| Precision | Fluted parallel gold lines, perfectly spaced and aligned — machined perfection |

## Typography

- Bold condensed sans-serif with strong vertical emphasis — tall, narrow, commanding letterforms
- Display type with dramatic stroke contrast: thick verticals and thin horizontals, evoking 1920s poster lettering
- All-caps for headlines and titles, with generous letter-spacing creating an air of formality
- Gold metallic finish on type against black backgrounds; reversed white or cream on jewel-toned panels
- Geometric decorative capitals at the start of sections — angular, faceted letterforms with inline details
- Text framed within gold geometric cartouches or banner ribbons with pointed ends
- Numbers rendered in bold display style, often larger than surrounding text for dramatic emphasis
- NO script fonts, NO handwritten feel, NO rounded friendly type — everything is architectural, angular, and authoritative
- Subtle inline or shadow effects on headlines to suggest depth and dimensionality

## Anti-Patterns

- NOT a flat corporate template with gold accent lines — must feel genuinely luxurious, dimensional, and handcrafted in its geometry
- NOT Art Nouveau: no flowing organic whiplash curves, no botanical motifs, no sinuous asymmetry. Art Deco is angular, symmetrical, and machined where Art Nouveau is organic and flowing
- NOT Bauhaus: no primary-color expressionist abstraction, no Kandinsky-style floating compositions, no warm parchment casualness. Art Deco is opulent and formal where Bauhaus is experimental and academic
- NOT a generic "gold border on black" — the gold elements must form specific Art Deco motifs (sunbursts, fans, chevrons, zigzags, stepped forms) not just any gold trim
- NOT a modern minimalist take — Art Deco is maximalist in its ornament. The geometry should be richly detailed, not stripped down to bare shapes
- This must look like the lobby of the Chrysler Building or a 1920s luxury hotel ballroom, not a PowerPoint template with a gold theme applied
