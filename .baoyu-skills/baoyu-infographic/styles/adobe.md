High-contrast creative platform design — bold white headlines punching out of jet-black hero sections, Adobe red (#EB1000) as a commanding accent, text-heavy bento cards on clean grey grounds, and pill-shaped outline buttons. A design system built on confidence: massive typography, strong color blocking, and content-rich cards that mix solid color fills, photographic imagery, and generous body copy. Premium without being precious.

## Visual Elements

- Massive bold sans-serif headlines (Adobe Clean Black) in pure #000000 black on light backgrounds or #FFFFFF white on black/red backgrounds — 60-96pt equivalent, tight letter-spacing, the headline IS the design
- Text-heavy rounded cards (12-16px radius) containing: bold headline + 2-3 lines of body copy + a pill-shaped outline button at the bottom — cards are content containers, not just image frames
- Bento grid layout — cards of varying sizes (1×1, 2×1, 1×2) arranged in a tight grid with 12-16px gaps, some cards tall, some wide, creating visual rhythm
- #EB1000 Adobe red used boldly — as full card background fills with white text, as banner strips, as button fills, as accent lines. Red = action, urgency, brand.
- Pure #000000 black sections for hero areas — large white headlines, supporting grey body text, red accent buttons
- #F5F5F5 light grey as the default ground color — cards float above it in white, red, black, or accent colors
- Pill-shaped outline buttons — rounded capsule shape, thin #000000 or #FFFFFF stroke, no fill, clean label text inside
- Creative mixed-media imagery INSIDE cards — NOT clean stock photos. Think: vibrant street photography with graffiti walls and bold color blocking, editorial collage with objects breaking out of frames, photography mixed with hand-drawn illustration elements, sparkle/star decorative accents, folk-art-style illustrations with halftone dot textures, oversized red typography overlapping with photographic subjects
- People shown in creative, expressive contexts — fashion-forward, colorful environments, vibrant lighting, personality-driven, never generic corporate headshots
- Collage-style layering where images, typography, illustrations, and UI elements overlap and intersect — objects breaking out of card boundaries, text sitting on top of photos with bold confidence
- #E8E8E8 border lines separating sections — thin, clean, structural
- Red #EB1000 banner strip — a thin horizontal bar spanning the full width, used for announcements or visual punctuation between sections
- Body text in Adobe Clean Regular, #666666 on light backgrounds — readable, generous, never skimped on. Cards should contain real text, not just headlines.

## Compositional Patterns

| Content Structure | Composition | Reference |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Black hero section at top with massive white headline, descending into #F5F5F5 grey section with bento card grid, then white section, then dark footer — contrast creates hierarchy | Adobe Summit page structure |
| Flow/process | Horizontal row of numbered cards on #F5F5F5, each card containing a step headline + body copy + icon, connected by implicit left-to-right flow | Feature walkthrough card row |
| Connections | Bento grid where related cards share a row and unrelated cards are separated by size variation — proximity = connection | Summit bento card grid |
| Cycles | Cards arranged in a circular or 2×2 grid, each representing a phase, color-coded with accent palette, arrows or numbered sequence | Workflow cycle |
| Comparison | Two large cards side by side — one #EB1000 red background with white text, one white with black text — maximum contrast between the compared items | Summit session cards (red vs white) |
| Categories | Grid of same-sized cards, each with a different accent color top bar or background fill, categorized content inside each | Feature category grid |
| Growth | Cards increasing in size from left to right, background transitioning from #F5F5F5 to white to #EB1000 red for the culmination | Progressive feature reveal |
| Networks | Central large card surrounded by smaller cards on #F5F5F5 ground, thin #E8E8E8 lines suggesting connections | Product ecosystem layout |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

| Abstract Concept | Adobe Metaphor |
|------------------|----------------|
| Data/information | Large bold numbers in #000000 black inside white cards, supporting text in #666666, red accent on key metrics |
| Processes | Sequential bento cards with step numbers in #EB1000 red circles, body copy explaining each step |
| Systems | Nested cards — large card containing smaller cards within, hierarchy through containment |
| Connections | Cards in close proximity on the bento grid, shared color coding |
| Growth | Cards gaining intensity — from #F5F5F5 grey outline to white fill to #EB1000 red fill |
| Time | Left-to-right card timeline, date labels as small pill tags in #666666 |
| Hierarchy | Size and color — largest card in #000000 black with white headline at top, smaller #F5F5F5 grey cards below |
| Protection | Card with #B9E0DB mint or #F5F5F5 grey fill enclosing content, subtle safe feeling |
| Speed | #EB1000 red card — red signals urgency and action |
| Stability | Large #000000 black section anchoring the composition, solid and confident |
| Users/people | Creative portraits in vibrant colorful environments — street photography, editorial styling, personality-driven, not corporate headshots |
| Ideas | #FBE87A warm yellow accent — a yellow card or highlight drawing attention |
| Energy | #EB1000 Adobe red at full strength — a red banner, a red card, red impossible to ignore |
| Creativity | Mixed-media collage — photography + illustration + bold typography overlapping, sparkle accents, objects breaking out of frames |

## Typography

- Adobe Clean Black for headlines — massive, bold, tight letter-spacing, #000000 on light or #FFFFFF on dark/red
- Adobe Clean Bold for card headlines — 24-36pt equivalent, #000000 on white cards, #FFFFFF on dark/red cards
- Adobe Clean Regular for body text — 14-16pt equivalent, #666666 on light backgrounds, #CCCCCC on dark, generous line-height (1.6), always included in cards — cards are text-rich, not text-shy
- Adobe Clean Light for captions, metadata, fine print — #999999, small but readable
- Pill button labels in Adobe Clean Medium — #000000 or #FFFFFF, centered inside capsule outline
- Headlines left-aligned within cards, centered only in hero sections
- No serif fonts, no handwriting, no decorative faces — Adobe Clean family only

## Anti-Patterns

- NOT pastel and soft — this design has CONTRAST. Black backgrounds, red accents, strong typography weight. The previous version was too gentle.
- NOT icon-heavy with minimal text — Adobe cards contain REAL copy: headlines, 2-3 lines of body text, and a CTA button. Cards are text-rich content containers.
- NOT using generic greys — there is a specific grey hierarchy: #F5F5F5 (grounds), #E8E8E8 (borders), #CCCCCC (disabled), #666666 (body text), #333333 (subheads)
- NOT clean stock photography — imagery should be creative, editorial, mixed-media: collage, vibrant street photography, illustration overlaid on photos, objects breaking out of frames
- NOT a light-only design — black hero sections and red card fills provide essential contrast and drama
- NOT generic corporate headshots — people in vibrant, colorful, personality-driven contexts
- This must look like Adobe's creative marketing — bold collage energy, oversized red typography overlapping imagery, sparkle accents, mixed media — not a sterile corporate page
