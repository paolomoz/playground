# Art Nouveau Style Guide

Art Nouveau (1890-1910) - "New Art" movement characterized by organic flowing lines, natural forms, and elegant ornamentation. Also known as Jugendstil (Germany), Stile Liberty (Italy), Modernisme (Catalonia).

## Visual Characteristics

**Line work**
- Sinuous, flowing curves inspired by natural forms
- "Whiplash" curves - long, undulating lines
- Asymmetrical but balanced compositions
- Lines that flow into and become forms
- Elegant, continuous outlines

**Form treatment**
- Organic shapes derived from plants, flowers, insects
- Forms that grow and intertwine
- Negative space as active design element
- Stylized rather than realistic nature
- Decorative borders and frames integral to composition

**Texture**
- Smooth gradients suggesting depth
- Subtle shading within organic forms
- Metallic accents (gold, bronze, copper)
- Stained glass luminosity effect
- Rich, layered decorative patterns

## Color Palette

**Primary palette** (use these terms in prompts):
- Sage green - muted botanical green
- Dusty rose - soft pink with grey undertone
- Gold/bronze - warm metallic accents
- Peacock blue - deep teal-blue
- Ivory/cream - warm white backgrounds
- Burgundy - deep wine red
- Olive - yellow-green earth tone
- Copper - warm metallic orange-brown

**Palette combinations**:
- Classic: sage green + dusty rose + gold + ivory
- Rich: peacock blue + burgundy + gold + cream
- Natural: olive + copper + ivory + sage
- Elegant: gold + black + ivory + dusty rose

## Compositional Patterns

**For infographics, use these Art Nouveau compositions**:

| Concept Type | Composition | Art Nouveau Reference |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical growing vine/tree structure | Klimt's Tree of Life |
| Flow/process | Flowing hair/water/ribbon motifs | Mucha poster borders |
| Connections | Intertwining stems and tendrils | Morris wallpaper patterns |
| Cycles | Circular floral wreaths, seasons | Mucha's seasons series |
| Comparison | Mirrored organic forms, symmetry | Architectural facades |
| Categories | Distinct flower blooms on shared stem | Botanical illustrations |
| Growth | Unfurling ferns, blooming flowers | Tiffany glass patterns |
| Networks | Root systems, neural vine patterns | Gaudi organic structures |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

Transform abstract concepts into Art Nouveau visual vocabulary:

| Abstract Concept | Visual Metaphor |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Flowing water, seeds, pollen |
| Processes | Growing vines, unfurling leaves, streams |
| Systems | Trees, root networks, flower structures |
| Connections | Intertwining tendrils, woven stems |
| Growth | Blooming flowers, sprouting seeds, butterflies emerging |
| Time | Seasons, day/night, flower lifecycle |
| Hierarchy | Tree branches, stem to bloom progression |
| Communication | Birds, bees, floating seeds, wind |
| Storage | Seed pods, cocoons, nests |
| Protection | Thorns, shells, bark, petals enclosing |
| Speed | Swallows, dragonflies, flowing water |
| Stability | Oak trees, deep roots, stone with moss |
| Users/people | Stylized figures with flowing hair/robes |
| Ideas | Light rays, stars, glowing centers |
| Energy | Sunbursts, radiating patterns, flames |

## Example Prompts

**Concept: Machine learning pipeline**
```
Art Nouveau style infographic, data flowing as a stream of water transforming 
into a blooming tree, raw data as seeds at the roots, processing layers as 
trunk sections with ornate bark patterns, trained model as flowering crown 
with golden fruit, elegant sinuous curves throughout, sage green and gold 
with peacock blue accents, decorative vine border framing the composition, 
Alphonse Mucha inspired, educational diagram aesthetic
```

**Concept: Microservices architecture**
```
Art Nouveau style infographic, garden of distinct flowering plants representing 
services, each bloom unique but sharing intertwined root system below ground, 
bees and butterflies carrying pollen between flowers as API calls, central 
trellis structure as gateway, flowing organic lines connecting all elements, 
dusty rose and sage green with copper accents, ornate botanical border, 
stylized natural forms, William Morris decorative pattern influence
```

**Concept: User journey mapping**
```
Art Nouveau style infographic, elegant figure with flowing hair walking along 
a winding path through seasons, spring awareness with cherry blossoms, summer 
consideration with full blooms, autumn decision with fruit, winter loyalty 
with evergreen, path decorated with milestone stones, sinuous curves guiding 
the eye, ivory and gold with burgundy accents, Mucha poster composition, 
decorative frame with integrated stage labels
```

**Concept: CI/CD pipeline**
```
Art Nouveau style infographic, metamorphosis of butterfly from egg to flight, 
code commit as ornate egg, build as caterpillar on decorative leaf, test as 
chrysalis with geometric patterns, deploy as emerging butterfly with 
iridescent wings, continuous loop suggested by circular vine wreath, 
peacock blue and gold with sage accents, flowing lines connecting stages, 
stained glass luminosity effect, elegant organic curves
```

## Substyle Variations
