# Ukiyo-e Style Guide

Ukiyo-e (浮世絵, "pictures of the floating world") - Japanese woodblock print aesthetic from the Edo period (1603-1868).

## Visual Characteristics

**Line work**
- Bold, confident black outlines (sumi ink)
- Clean, precise contours defining all elements
- Varying line weights for depth and emphasis
- No sketchy or rough edges

**Color treatment**
- Flat color areas with no gradients within shapes
- Limited palette per image (typically 5-8 colors)
- Colors appear layered, as if printed sequentially
- Subtle color bleeding at edges (bokashi effect for skies/water)

**Texture**
- Visible wood grain texture suggestion
- Paper texture undertone
- No photorealistic rendering
- Matte, non-glossy appearance

## Color Palette

**Traditional colors** (use these terms in prompts):
- Indigo blue (ai-iro) - deep blue, primary accent
- Vermillion red (shu) - bright orange-red
- Prussian blue (bero-ai) - rich dark blue
- Safflower pink (beni) - soft pink
- Yellow ochre (odo) - muted gold/yellow
- Verdigris green (rokusho) - blue-green patina
- Sumi black - pure black for outlines
- Unprinted paper white - warm cream background

**Palette combinations**:
- Classic: indigo + vermillion + black + paper white
- Nature: verdigris green + ochre + indigo + pink
- Dramatic: Prussian blue + vermillion + black + white

## Compositional Patterns

**For infographics, use these traditional compositions**:

| Concept Type | Composition | Ukiyo-e Reference |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Hierarchy/levels | Vertical stacking with clouds separating layers | Mountain landscapes |
| Flow/process | Diagonal movement, water/path motifs | River scenes, Tokaido road |
| Connections | Bridges, boats between islands | Harbor scenes |
| Cycles | Circular wave patterns, seasonal motifs | Great Wave, cherry blossoms |
| Comparison | Side-by-side panels (diptych style) | Bijin-ga portraits |
| Categories | Distinct floating islands or platforms | Floating world scenes |

## Visual Metaphor Mappings

Transform abstract concepts into Ukiyo-e visual vocabulary:

| Abstract Concept | Visual Metaphor |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Data/information | Scrolls, paper documents, flowing water |
| Processes | Paths, rivers, bridges, journeys |
| Systems | Islands, buildings, districts |
| Connections | Bridges, boats, flying cranes |
| Growth | Cherry blossoms, bamboo, pine trees |
| Time | Seasons, moon phases, tides |
| Hierarchy | Mountain layers, castle levels |
| Communication | Messengers, birds, banners |
| Storage | Warehouses, chests, vessels |
| Protection | Castle walls, samurai, barriers |
| Speed | Running horses, swift water, wind |
| Stability | Mountains, ancient trees, stones |

## Prompt Structure Template

```
Ukiyo-e woodblock print style infographic, [main subject as visual metaphor], 
[secondary elements], [composition description], bold black sumi outlines,

```

## Prompt Vocabulary

**Always include**:
- "Ukiyo-e woodblock print style"
- "bold black outlines" or "sumi ink outlines"
- "flat color areas"

**Style reinforcers**:
- "Japanese Edo period aesthetic"
- "traditional woodblock printing technique"
- "inspired by Hokusai/Hiroshige" (for specific substyles)

**Background elements**:
- "traditional Japanese cloud patterns (kumo)"
- "stylized wave patterns"
- "bokashi gradient sky"
- "gold leaf accents"
- "paper texture visible"

**Compositional terms**:
- "horizontal scroll composition"
- "vertical kakemono format"
- "triptych panel arrangement"
- "floating elements on neutral ground"

## Example Prompts

**Concept: Cloud computing architecture**
```
Ukiyo-e woodblock print style infographic, floating castle in the sky representing 
cloud services, smaller buildings below connected by ascending bridges, data scrolls 
carried by cranes flying between levels, bold black sumi outlines, flat color areas 
in indigo blue and vermillion red, traditional Japanese cloud patterns surrounding 
the castle, Mount Fuji silhouette in background, educational diagram aesthetic
```

**Concept: Agile development cycle**
```
Ukiyo-e woodblock print style infographic, circular arrangement of four seasonal 
scenes representing sprint cycles, cherry blossoms for planning, summer festival 
for development, autumn harvest for review, winter reflection for retrospective, 
craftsmen working in each scene, bold black outlines, flat colors in verdigris 
green ochre and pink, flowing water connecting all seasons in endless cycle, 
traditional Japanese art aesthetic
```

**Concept: API gateway pattern**
```
Ukiyo-e woodblock print style infographic, grand torii gate at center as the 
gateway, travelers and merchants passing through with scrolls and goods, multiple 
paths leading to distinct districts beyond, guardian komainu statues filtering 
entry, bold black sumi outlines, flat color areas in Prussian blue and vermillion, 
stylized clouds above, educational diagram showing traffic flow, Edo period aesthetic
```

## Substyle Variations

**Hokusai style** - dramatic nature, dynamic movement
- Add: "dramatic waves", "bold natural forces", "dynamic composition"
- Best for: energy, power, transformation concepts

**Hiroshige style** - serene landscapes, atmospheric depth
- Add: "atmospheric perspective", "rain or mist effects", "peaceful scenes"
- Best for: journey, process, gradual change concepts

**Bijin-ga style** - elegant figures, refined details
- Add: "elegant figures", "refined patterns", "sophisticated composition"
- Best for: user personas, service design, human-centered concepts

## Concept Difficulty Guide

Ukiyo-e's bold compositional vocabulary handles most concepts well. Watch for these:

| Concept Type | Difficulty | Stronger Metaphor Strategy |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Flow/pipeline | Easy | River system with boats carrying cargo through processing stations |
| Hierarchy/levels | Easy | Mountain with distinct plateaus, or multi-story castle — natural Ukiyo-e subject |
| Management/orchestration | Easy | Samurai general commanding troops with war fan — strong cultural fit |
| Cycles | Easy | Seasonal motifs, circular wave patterns |
| Factory/production | Medium | Nighttime workshop with lanterns, craftsmen at stations — add moon for "overnight" |
| Networks/connections | Medium | Bridges between islands, cranes carrying messages between groups |
| Freedom/rebellion | Easy | Pirate ships, breaking waves, warriors breaking through barriers |

**Key rule:** Ukiyo-e excels at hierarchy and command structures. Use military/samurai metaphors for management and orchestration concepts.

## Prompt Suffix

**Always end every prompt with:** `no text, no labels, no words, no letters, no writing, no captions, no signs, purely visual`

**Avoid these words** in prompts (they cause AI to bake in garbled text): `infographic`, `diagram`, `educational`, `chart`, `annotated`

## Anti-patterns (Avoid)

- Photorealistic rendering
- Soft gradients within shapes
- 3D perspective with vanishing points
- Modern typography or UI elements
- Neon or fluorescent colors
- Drop shadows or glows
- Sketchy or rough line work
