## Executive Summary

Paolo Mottadelli presented the current thinking on the team's mission and goals ahead of a workshop the following week. The team's mission is to **accelerate AEM growth and adoption** by deeply engaging with customers to discover, validate, and scale "accelerators" that drive customer success. The methodology centers on rapid experimentation, close customer partnership, and AI-driven capabilities.

The meeting introduced the **accelerator model** (inspired by the "pancake chart" approach) as the framework for how the team will operate: running small, parallel experiments with customers, tracking which ones produce real value, and turning validated accelerators into established initiatives. Experience Catalyst and Digital Insights are the two current established initiatives. The team will measure success through **usage metrics** rather than direct dollar revenue.

A strong emphasis was placed on **AI-first ways of working** -- the team is expected to fundamentally change how it operates by leveraging AI tools for coding, planning, content creation, and customer engagement. The workshop the following week will focus on putting this into practice.

## Key Points

### Mission Statement
- **Mission**: Accelerate AEM growth and adoption by deeply engaging with customers to discover, validate, and scale the accelerators that drive their success
- Through rapid experimentation and close customer partnership, identify AI-driven capabilities and modernization pathways that unlock real value
- Turn engineering breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines for the broader AEM ecosystem

### Strategic Customer Journey Framework
- The team operates across the full customer lifecycle: pre-sales (blue) and post-sales (green), viewed as a continuous loop
- Three key intervention areas along the customer journey:
  1. **Intelligent Value Discovery** -- reaching the right customer, right stakeholder, right message, right time
  2. **Personalisation** -- showing specific, outcome-based value (e.g., Digital Insights)
  3. **Reducing Migration Barriers** -- decreasing the complexity and cost of moving to AEM (e.g., Experience Catalyst)
- The "engineered path" (blue line) vs. the status quo (orange line) represents the uplift the team aims to deliver

### The Accelerator Model
- An "accelerator" is any contribution that raises the value line at any customer journey stage
- Accelerators progress through stages: Experiment -> Customer Use -> Validated -> Made to Product
- Three impact phases: **Acquisition** (new customers), **Adoption** (turning buyers into active users), **Expansion** (increasing usage and value)
- Current established initiatives: Experience Catalyst, Digital Insights
- New experiments will continuously feed the pipeline

### Pancake Chart Methodology
- Borrowed from Philippe Kocic's Astra team, adopted more broadly across AEM
- Innovation flows from: Experience -> Learning -> Hypothesis -> Experiment -> Customer Engagement -> Product
- The team will track metrics like customer interactions, experiments run, learnings converted to product

### Value Framework (6+1)
- Six types of value: perceived value, contractual value (Adobe revenue), top-line value (customer outcome), GA usage, bottom-line value (cost cutting), post-GA usage, plus one more
- For the team specifically: success measured by **usage**, not direct dollar impact
- At product level, Adobe continues communicating value to customers in dollar terms

### AI-First & Rapid Experimentation
- The team must fundamentally change how it works using AI
- Goal: deliver 10x faster, not by working 10x harder
- Vibe coding, AI-assisted planning, content creation, and customer engagement
- First step: invest in the team itself to learn new ways of working
- Workshop next week will focus on practical AI adoption

### Operating Model
- Small parallel experiments: 5-7 customer engagements running simultaneously, 1-2 people each
- Select customers that can move fast (e.g., Sunstar, Vitamix) alongside longer-term strategic ones (e.g., AstraZeneca)
- Short iteration cycles; quick decisions to continue or stop experiments

> "We don't want to do anything that is known already. Everything we do, we want to do it with very rapid experimentation." - Paolo Mottadelli

> "Deliver 10x, deliver 10x not by working 10x, maybe working 0.5x." - Paolo Mottadelli

> "The really interesting bit is that on the surface, a lot of what you said sounds like coming back to the old culture texture ideas. But what has fundamentally changed is the speed with which we can do it." - Karl Pauls

> "They had the idea and they basically released it first, second week of January. It was all written by Claude Code." - Karl Pauls (on Cloud Co-Work)

> "We don't talk about sales, we talk about usage." - Paolo Mottadelli

> "Nothing is set in stone yet. This is an invite to all of you to help us shape and create." - Nicole Glauser

## Key Takeaways

1. The team's identity is centered on being a **rapid experimentation engine** that discovers and validates accelerators across the AEM customer journey -- from acquisition through expansion.
2. Success is measured by **customer usage and adoption**, not direct revenue attribution. The accelerator model (experiment -> customer use -> validated -> product) provides the tracking framework.
3. **AI-first ways of working** is not just a product direction but a team operating principle -- the workshop next week is intended to put this into practice with concrete experiments and tooling.
4. The team will run **small, parallel customer engagements** (1-2 people each) rather than large monolithic projects, enabling faster iteration and broader coverage.
5. **Experience Catalyst** and **Digital Insights** are the two established initiatives; new experiments will continuously feed the pipeline of potential new accelerators.

## Action Items & Next Steps
- Paolo to share: mission document, goals document, slides, 6+1 value framework
- Follow-up discussion on goals (possibly later in the week or Monday)
- Workshop next week: hands-on AI adoption, session with Lars Dierolf (Tuesday), session with Cedric (Tuesday), talk with Philippe Kocic
- Team invited to contribute ideas and shape the mission/goals before they are finalised

# Organized Transcript

> Filler words removed, organized by topic sections.

## [0:16] Introduction and Context

**Paolo Mottadelli**: The context of the change was discussed a couple of weeks ago. Last week was a waiting week because of the off-site in the US. Next week the team will meet to kickstart the new focus and mission -- doubling down on clear objectives. Today's goal is to share the current status of the team mission and goals. This is the current thinking, not final. The team will refine and define the goals together. Questions and discussion are welcome throughout.

## [3:09] Strategic View: The Engineered Customer Journey

**Paolo Mottadelli**: Starting with strategic content relevant to the whole Foundation, not just this team. This is a view being developed with Alex and others describing what the team wants to do to help AEM accelerate growth and adoption.

The bottom of the slide shows standard Adobe sales stages. Blue represents pre-sales, green represents post-sales. These should be seen as a loop -- enterprise customers have long-lasting engagements with renewal, upsell, and expansion. Two types of pre-sales engagements: acquiring new customers and expanding existing customers.

The orange line represents what's happening today. The blue line represents the "engineered path" -- what can happen if the team improves. Engineering actively participates in the direct customer journey, not doing pre-sales work, but making the product better support how customers get value.

Three key areas of focus:

1. **Intelligent Value Discovery**: Finding the best way to reach the right customer, right stakeholder, with the right motivation and triggers at the right time. Making the information Adobe has actionable for sales. Knowing what to say to what person can accelerate business significantly.

2. **Personalisation**: Showing outcome-specific information. Not just "AEM will increase your LLM visibility" but "you will be able to get here with us because of this if you engage." Digital Insights is the existing example.

3. **Reducing Migration Barriers**: The biggest barrier for adoption and expansion in enterprise environments is moving to the new technology. This comes with huge complexity and cost -- enterprise complexity, not product capabilities. Decreasing this barrier by any percentage increases the business. This is well demonstrated.

These three areas form a continuous loop through value realisation and back.

## [13:45] Mission Statement

**Paolo Mottadelli**: The mission: **Accelerate AEM growth and adoption by deeply engaging with customers to discover, validate, and scale the accelerators that drive their success.**

Methodology: Through rapid experimentation and close customer partnership, identify AI-driven capabilities and modernisation pathways that unlock real value. Turn engineering breakthroughs into repeatable growth engines for the broader AEM ecosystem.

Keywords: rapid experimentation, customer partnership, AI-driven, modernisation, real value.

## [17:00] The Accelerator Concept

**Paolo Mottadelli**: The practical work is made of many small contributions, each called an "accelerator." One accelerator could increase perceived value.

Example: Since EDS was presented to customers, showing fast development has been very hard. Customers have responded with "I don't see the value" or "pure JavaScript is going to be more complicated" or "EDS is just for static sites." This has been going on for two years. With Experience Catalyst, customers now want EDS. In December, a POC was presented for a Skoda website (part of Volkswagen). Around 200 pages were imported showing good look and feel. The decision maker, who had been pushing for traditional AEM, asked "Is this already available?" When told it requires EDS, he said "OK, let's go with EDS."

Other accelerators mapped to sales stages: decision-making triggers (stages 6-7), customer outreach and attention (S1-S2 via Digital Insights), and adoption acceleration (earlier and higher value realisation through Experience Catalyst). With enterprise customers, long time-to-value causes loss of context -- people change, goals change, focus shifts.

## [25:00] Pancake Chart Methodology

**Paolo Mottadelli**: Introducing the pancake chart approach using Philippe Kocic's Astra team as an example. The Astra team (10 or fewer people) focused on assets and asset share.

The approach: innovate by starting with a hypothesis, maturing it through steps toward certainty. Start with experience, derive a learning, form a hypothesis, then experiment. Examples from the Astra team: auto-generating accessible alt text using AI, speed of development through agentic coding.

The second step is customer engagement -- experiments landing into customer use. The team tracks: customer interactions, experiments run, learnings converted to customer use, learnings converted to product.

This approach has been adopted by more teams in recent months. The team will embrace and customise it.

## [35:44] Q&A: Value Measurement

**Florian Froese**: Is the value realised for the customer or for Adobe revenue? Does Adobe get paid once the contract is signed?

**Paolo Mottadelli**: There is a framework of six types of value: perceived value, contractual value (Adobe revenue), top-line value (customer outcome), GA usage, bottom-line value (cost cutting), post-GA usage. Anything the team does should map to one of these six values.

At product level, value is communicated to customers in dollars. P42 agents are charged per usage based on actual value (e.g., paying per page imported, not per token burned).

For the team specifically: no direct dollar revenue targets. The driving metrics are usage -- how many pages customers imported with Experience Catalyst, how many deals instrumented with Digital Insights, how many deals reported impact.

**Timothee Maret**: How do we quantify value when it's facilitation rather than a product? Did the Astra team find a way?

**Jose Correia**: They tracked customer interactions as a major KPI.

**Paolo Mottadelli**: We measure success by use. Was a customer interested? Did they use it? Did they put it in production?

## [42:05] Q&A: Sales Stages and Cross-Product Reality

**Jose Correia**: Digital Insights has been used across all stages, from stage 1 outreach to days before contract signing. Stages are not set in stone -- sales doesn't always update them. Don't guide too much by stages.

**Mike**: AEM isn't the only conversation happening with a customer. Other products (Campaign, AEP, etc.) are part of the same deal, which is why stage 5 is often very long.

**Jose Correia**: Sometimes helping progress other products (like Workfront) also accelerates closing the AEM deal.

**Nicole Glauser**: From the customer's perspective, they discuss Adobe, not individual products. The art is coming up with a cohesive story. We're supporting Adobe footprint growth with the customer.

**Mike**: Practical example: demo to AstraZeneca this afternoon with Figma-to-AEM and approvals in Workfront. Digital Insights is expanding into Commerce and Workfront.

## [56:48] Modernisation and AI Adoption

**Paolo Mottadelli**: One of the main reasons for doubling down on rapid experimentation: the pace of AI adoption demands it. Customer expectations are changing dramatically. The team is well-equipped for this.

The team should not do anything that is already known. Everything should be new experimentation, done rapidly with short iterations.

Reference to Cedric's concept: when you learn something new, how much of your brain refactors current knowledge? Usually 2% -- if you get to 10%, you're exceptional. Long-lasting plans will be subject to heavy refactoring, so the team needs continuously refactored plans with short iterations.

Fundamentally changing how the team works using AI. Vibe coding, AI-assisted planning. The team should be AI-first driven -- working on top of a growing context, shortcutting everything possible with AI tools.

## [1:05:31] Q&A: Parallel Experiments and Customer Speed

**Carlos Sanchez**: If customers can't keep up with our speed, should we run multiple experiments in parallel or find faster customers?

**Paolo Mottadelli**: Both. Select customers that can move fast (Sunstar, Vitamix, Post). Also maintain longer-term strategic engagements (AstraZeneca). The ideal state: 10-14 people running 5-7 customer engagements in parallel, 1-2 people each, with fast cycles.

## [1:08:57] AI-Driven Speed of Delivery

**Karl Pauls**: On the surface this sounds like the old Culture Tech ideas -- work with customers, find use cases, bring back to product. What has fundamentally changed is the speed. Cloud Co-Work started as an idea before Christmas and released in the first or second week of January, reportedly all written by Claude Code. The Experience Catalyst pivot took 3-4 days for the first prototype, with people using it a week later. We need to get better at executing at this speed.

**Paolo Mottadelli**: 80-90% of the workshop next week should be about this. Deliver 10x by working 0.5x. The team will challenge itself on everything it does. Beyond coding: operations, meetings, planning, finding customers. The first step is investing in the team -- finding the right way to learn new ways of doing things.

Examples: building infographics from meeting content, compressing information into visuals, creating podcasts at the push of a button, making meeting information available in consumable ways.

Philippe Kocic's team vibe codes everything they do with customers. Sessions scheduled next week: Lars Dierolf and Cedric on Tuesday.

## [1:18:58] Goals Overview (Brief)

**Paolo Mottadelli**: Quick walkthrough of the goals document. The accelerator model defines how goals are structured:
- Three phases: Acquisition, Adoption, Expansion
- Accelerator progression: Experiment -> Customer Use -> Validated -> Made to Product
- Established initiatives (Experience Catalyst, Digital Insights) tracked by usage KPIs
- New experiments feed the pipeline; some become new established initiatives

## [1:24:10] Wrap-Up

**Mike**: Only 6 minutes left; suggests sharing documents asynchronously or scheduling another call.

**Paolo Mottadelli**: Will share: slides, mission document, goals document, 6+1 values. Possible follow-up meeting this week. Team Slack channel for async discussion. Thanks everyone -- excited about the opportunity to change with how the world is changing.
